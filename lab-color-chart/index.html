                                                <p> Boy, did we have big waves this week: 20-foot right here at our
                                                    house.</p>
                                                <p> The water depth drops off quickly at our house.</p>
                                                <p> We don't have a reef offshore, and the waves break right next to the
                                                    cliffs.</p>
                                                <p> My dog was afraid.</p>
                                                <p> The waves were so big that she would just shudder at night from the
                                                    sound, but she's just a puppy and she'll get used to it because this
                                                    is where we live.</p>
                                                <p> Wow, look at that: just amazing, just amazing.</p>
                                                <p> It was hard to get anything done this week with all the action, but
                                                    I made time.</p>
                                                <p> I could look at these all day long.</p>
                                                <p> This was from a giant storm south of Alaska, in the gulf of
                                                    Alaska.</p>
                                                <p> It pushed waves straight towards us; it was great.</p>
                                                <p> Usually, they come off at a little bit of an angle, so Maui and Oahu
                                                    get them, but not the Big Island.</p>
                                                <p> This was special for us.</p>
                                                <p> It's one of the reasons we moved close to the shore: so we could
                                                    hear the ocean at night.</p>
                                                <p> I hope you enjoy this as much as I do.</p>
                                                <p> The challenge is to keep the salt spray off your lens.</p>
                                                <p> If you go out early in the morning, there's an offshore breeze.</p>
                                                <p> That really helps in pushing the salt spray off the shore.</p>
                                                <p> So, you've got to get out early.</p>
                                                <p> This week I've been working on color.</p>
                                                <p> That was the theme.</p>
                                                <p> I looked at thousands of images and came up with a complete version
                                                    of my LAB Lookup Table.</p>
                                                <p> Here it is.</p>
                                                <p> I've got five different categories: People, Roadways, Foliage, Sky,
                                                    and Sun.</p>
                                                <p> Then, each of them are broken into their own categories: different
                                                    Foliage colors; different colors of sky: deep blue, dark sky, sunny
                                                    sky.</p>
                                                <p> Then I came up with LAB proportions that give you a starting point
                                                    with each of these.</p>
                                                <p> See, these give you a starting point for Skin Tones.</p>
                                                <p> Under Roadways, we've got Asphalt and Bricks and the paint on the
                                                    roads.</p>
                                                <p> I hope these help you as much as they help me.</p>
                                                <p> I was having a real hard time looking at colors when there's an
                                                    adjacent color that changes the way I perceive it, or when a color
                                                    is lighter or darker in a darker part of the image or a lighter part
                                                    of the image.</p>
                                                <p> These tables have really helped me a lot.</p>
                                                <p> I refer to them often, back and forth when I'm editing.</p>
                                                <p> We'll use them a little in today's guest edit.</p>
                                                <p> Also in the spirit of working on color, I re-calibrated my
                                                    monitor.</p>
                                                <p> That required installing new drivers and going through a web of
                                                    trying to get everything to work together.</p>
                                                <p> It didn't work as simply as it was supposed to.</p>
                                                <p> I had to use different versions of different libraries in some
                                                    specific pattern to make it go.</p>
                                                <p> It wasn't just the newest version of everything; it took a full day
                                                    of tinkering.</p>
                                                <p> Anyway, all the errors are now gone, and now it calibrates
                                                    properly.</p>
                                                <p> I set up two calibrations here in a little script.</p>
                                                <p> One of them, this one, is for doing web work, and this one is for
                                                    doing print work.</p>
                                                <p> I hot-key between them and use the soft-proofing in Darktable.</p>
                                                <p> I'll show you what that looks like.</p>
                                                <p> When I set it up for Web, when I run darktable-cmstest, it shows me
                                                    that I've got the Web Profile.</p>
                                                <p> If I change my profile to Print-based with my hot-key and run the
                                                    same darktable-cmstest, I see that I've got my Print Profile.</p>
                                                <p> So, if I've got my Print Profile and I open Darktable, I can go down
                                                    to Soft-proofing down here and select my paper and my printer.</p>
                                                <p> Then, when I click on Soft Proofing, I get a more accurate idea of
                                                    how my colors will stay in gamut and whatnot.</p>
                                                <p> It was a big project.</p>
                                                <p> I will go much more in depth at some point on Soft Proofing and
                                                    Color Profiling your camera, your printer, and your monitor.</p>
                                                <p> That's a subject for another day.</p>
                                                <p> I'd like to show you a website today: clarkvision.com This website
                                                    is such a gem.</p>
                                                <p> There's enough to keep you busy for days and days of reading
                                                    here.</p>
                                                <p> There is so much useful information.</p>
                                                <p> I suggest you come here and just go for it.</p>
                                                <p> This night photography series really caught my eye.</p>
                                                <p> He started working on this a couple years ago.</p>
                                                <p> It just gets better and better all the time.</p>
                                                <p> Looking at his pictures, I see that a lot of them are right next to
                                                    our place in Colorado.</p>
                                                <p> I love Colorado; it's so beautiful.</p>
                                                <p> In this week's Edit my RAW we have a beautiful picture from the
                                                    Lofoten Islands in Norway.</p>
                                                <p> From Andreas.</p>
                                                <p> Thank you so much, Andreas: this is beautiful.</p>
                                                <p> It just takes my breath away.</p>
                                                <p> We were in Scotland last year, and boy did I want to go to
                                                    Norway.</p>
                                                <p> Okay, I'm looking at this image and trying to figure out what's
                                                    going on here.</p>
                                                <p> It looks like there's a rocky outcropping.</p>
                                                <p> You can see there's a little bit of soft focus on the near
                                                    objects.</p>
                                                <p> It looks like our focus starts getting sharp right about here.</p>
                                                <p> I see from the EXIF data that we're shooting with a 12mm on a D7200,
                                                    which is a crop-frame sensor, so this is an equivalent 20mm on a
                                                    full-frame.</p>
                                                <p> I imagine that at F8 with a 20mm, probably everything from here to
                                                    infinity is perfectly in focus, so we may have to exclude some of
                                                    this foreground.</p>
                                                <p> But I find the foreground a little confusing because it doesn't
                                                    really add to the sense of depth.</p>
                                                <p> From this rock outward, I like it.</p>
                                                <p> My eye tends to go in a circle like this.</p>
                                                <p> That makes me want to use the Golden Means Spiral to get some idea
                                                    of flow.</p>
                                                <p> Here's the overlay.</p>
                                                <p> I use Golden Mean, and then under Extra, I selected Spiral.</p>
                                                <p> If I bring in this crop some so that the circle comes around like
                                                    this and ends me up over here, how does that work with my
                                                    foreground? Okay, I think I like that.</p>
                                                <p> Now, what are we losing over here? Well, this is in the shade and
                                                    there's not much happening here.</p>
                                                <p> We lose this part here, but it's a little soft on focus, and the
                                                    real spectacular stuff is over here.</p>
                                                <p> And we lose a little bit of this, but there are a lot of clouds here
                                                    and we have some soft focus out here.</p>
                                                <p> I think this is the way to go.</p>
                                                <p> Okay, so we'll do a little bit tighter crop here.</p>
                                                <p> That looks good to me.</p>
                                                <p> As a matter of fact, we'll just cut off that edge.</p>
                                                <p> So, we've got this rock and we've got some shrubs and then we come
                                                    around.</p>
                                                <p> We've got this beautiful expanse.</p>
                                                <p> This area here looks low-contrast.</p>
                                                <p> I want to bring out texture and height differences here.</p>
                                                <p> There are some strong shadows on the side of the mountain here.</p>
                                                <p> I want to bring that out so it doesn't look so harsh.</p>
                                                <p> Our contrast decreases as we go out toward the horizon.</p>
                                                <p> I'd like to have these mountains back here pop more because they're
                                                    so spectacular.</p>
                                                <p> I want to be sure our colors are good.</p>
                                                <p> I want to lighten this whole mountain because it's really the center
                                                    of my attention.</p>
                                                <p> I keep getting drawn to this face but it's in the shade.</p>
                                                <p> So, the idea is: while doing the edit, keep in mind this flow; have
                                                    this area here form a circle.</p>
                                                <p> I want to kind of hug this area, maybe delineate this from this
                                                    side, and that will give me more of this spiral.</p>
                                                <p> Let's look at our White Balance first.</p>
                                                <p> This is a perfect opportunity to use the LAB Color Chart.</p>
                                                <p> Now, we have some greens and we have some sky blue.</p>
                                                <p> Let's look at our sky blue first.</p>
                                                <p> Over here we'll use our Color Picker.</p>
                                                <p> It says that we've got a -5 and a -23.</p>
                                                <p> On the LAB Color Reference, let's see: Sky and I'd call that a pale
                                                    sky.</p>
                                                <p> It looks like if we're at an L of around 80, which we are actually,
                                                    then we should be at -5 and -23 --about there-- and we've got right
                                                    around -5 and...</p>
                                                <p> ...oh, it looks like we're right on the money.</p>
                                                <p> So our blue looks GREAT.</p>
                                                <p> Now, let's look at our Foliage.</p>
                                                <p> Let's zoom in down here.</p>
                                                <p> This is more yellowish foliage.</p>
                                                <p> Let's check our yellowish foliage first.</p>
                                                <p> So, we've got 50 and -8 and 33.</p>
                                                <p> Let's see: yellowish foliage.</p>
                                                <p> Here we are.</p>
                                                <p> If our L is around 50 -- well, this one shows it somewhere between
                                                    50 and 60, so we're in that ballpark; then our B Channel should be
                                                    about the same as our L.</p>
                                                <p> Our B Channel is a little low, but it's similar.</p>
                                                <p> Our A Channel should be around half as much, and we're at 8.</p>
                                                <p> A little more green wouldn't hurt us at all.</p>
                                                <p> But that's just one spot.</p>
                                                <p> Let's look at a darker green area too.</p>
                                                <p>And see what that gets us also.</p>
                                                <p>Because right now it looks like we've got too much yellow.</p>
                                                <p> How about this? That's a more blue-ish green.</p>
                                                <p> Okay, we've got 36, -4, and 7.</p>
                                                <p> Here we are.</p>
                                                <p> It says that our B Channel should be lower.</p>
                                                <p> Oh, it is; it's down to 7.</p>
                                                <p> Okay, that's about right.</p>
                                                <p> And our A Channel should be about the same as the yellowish green:
                                                    -4.</p>
                                                <p> Yeah, it looks like we're a little light on the green and a little
                                                    heavy on the yellow.</p>
                                                <p> Let's make a minor change to our temperature.</p>
                                                <p> So, we'll go a little higher on our tint and a little lower on the
                                                    temperature.</p>
                                                <p> Now let's see where we stand.</p>
                                                <p> Our blues: did we lose them? -5 and -17.</p>
                                                <p> Sky.</p>
                                                <p>-5 and -17; that looks close.</p>
                                                <p> Okay, and our greens now? We'll take a large swath and look for a
                                                    middle color: -7.5 and 22 and 43.</p>
                                                <p> Medium.</p>
                                                <p>43 would be Medium.</p>
                                                <p> B Channel should be around 30 and A Channel should be around
                                                    -20.</p>
                                                <p> We could use a little more color, and still a little more green.</p>
                                                <p> Okay a little more green.</p>
                                                <p> And a little less yellow: 5300.</p>
                                                <p> That's looking a lot better.</p>
                                                <p> And our blues? Are we still good on our blues? That looks good.</p>
                                                <p> And our clouds? Clouds should be almost exactly white, just a tiny
                                                    bit blue.</p>
                                                <p> Hmm...</p>
                                                <p>we've got some green in our clouds.</p>
                                                <p> Do we have green up here too? We do.</p>
                                                <p> Let's decrease the green as we go up.</p>
                                                <p> I'll combine that with a Parametric Mask.</p>
                                                <p> So if we get brighter too.</p>
                                                <p> And we'll bring our green down just a tiny bit.</p>
                                                <p> There we go.</p>
                                                <p> Our colors are good.</p>
                                                <p> What next? Apply a Base Curve.</p>
                                                <p> There are a couple of Nikons here: Nikon D7200.</p>
                                                <p> Let's see what that looks like.</p>
                                                <p> We'll have to adjust our Exposure.</p>
                                                <p> I'll do a Screenshot there.</p>
                                                <p> That's with the D7200.</p>
                                                <p> There's Nikon Like.</p>
                                                <p> What does that look like? It's a little flatter.</p>
                                                <p> I can bring the Exposure up a little because I've got a little room
                                                    here, so we can compare apples and apples.</p>
                                                <p> Well, the first one's got more pop, but I think the second one
                                                    controls our highlights better.</p>
                                                <p> And there was one other one: Nikon Like Alternate.</p>
                                                <p> Let's look at that.</p>
                                                <p> It's coming in a little hot here; I'll take down our Exposure so
                                                    we're comparing fairly again.</p>
                                                <p> Well, it does a better job on our highlights, and our shadows aren't
                                                    any worse.</p>
                                                <p> I like that one the best.</p>
                                                <p> There we go: we've got a Base Curve, we've got our Exposure set,
                                                    we've got our White Balance.</p>
                                                <p> I'll deal with Demosaic-ing, Chromatic Aberrations and Lens
                                                    Correction and Denoising at the end because that slows down the
                                                    re-draw time in processing.</p>
                                                <p> It's a little bright on top.</p>
                                                <p> It could stand a Graduated Density application.</p>
                                                <p> Bring our Midpoint up a little bit.</p>
                                                <p> Oh, that looks a little strong.</p>
                                                <p> Okay, a third of a stop looks right.</p>
                                                <p> It looks like I've got a little vignetting around the edges.</p>
                                                <p> Let's see if applying the Lens Correction gets rid of the
                                                    vignetting; if not, we'll apply a Watermark.</p>
                                                <p> Lens Correction.</p>
                                                <p> Okay, there's the D7200, and it says it doesn't have this lens.</p>
                                                <p> We'll have to find one that's close to it.</p>
                                                <p> Okay, it helped with the de-warping, but it didn't do anything for
                                                    the vignetting.</p>
                                                <p> Do we like what it did for the de-warping? Oh, it stretches these
                                                    edges and doesn't give us any advantage.</p>
                                                <p> No, I'll leave that off.</p>
                                                <p> Okay, we'll deal with the vignet manually.</p>
                                                <p> Where does it start? I think this is pretty close.</p>
                                                <p> It starts about here and goes out.</p>
                                                <p> I'll take my Falloff Strength, there we go, and have it end right
                                                    there.</p>
                                                <p> Then, instead of darkening it, I want to brighten it.</p>
                                                <p> So, instead of a minus brightness, I'll go to a plus brightness.</p>
                                                <p> Okay, that looks better.</p>
                                                <p> I got 1.4 over here, and we're losing color out our edges because
                                                    this has a minus saturation by default, so I'll make that at least
                                                    zero, if not give it a little plus: not much, just a tiny bit to
                                                    keep up with the brightness.</p>
                                                <p> Otherwise, when you brighten it, you'll lose saturation.</p>
                                                <p> Well, that's a starting point.</p>
                                                <p> We have strong shadows, obviously, from the clouds and from the
                                                    sides of the mountain.</p>
                                                <p> And we've got areas in bright sunshine.</p>
                                                <p> This looks like a perfect application for the Shadows and Highlights
                                                    Module.</p>
                                                <p> When we first turn it on, you can see that we get halos around all
                                                    these edges.</p>
                                                <p> But if we change the Soften Width to Bilateral Filter, they pretty
                                                    much go away.</p>
                                                <p> I can adjust how much of the shadows get brightened -- for instance,
                                                    this area would probably be considered shadows, and if I increase
                                                    the brightness there it brings them up, which is good.</p>
                                                <p> And the highlights, these clouds over here, we probably want to
                                                    knock them down some.</p>
                                                <p> So, we'll bring our slider down a little more.</p>
                                                <p> These are the numbers I came up with.</p>
                                                <p> Radius will determine the distance between where it thinks a shadow
                                                    and where it thinks a highlight is, and the rest of the picture.</p>
                                                <p> We can adjust this to give us a more natural look and eliminate
                                                    halos.</p>
                                                <p> If I make it too small, you can start to see halos around
                                                    things.</p>
                                                <p> So, I'll bring up the size until I just get rid of the halos.</p>
                                                <p> Then the Compression: the higher the Compression, the more it will
                                                    only consider the darkest things shadows.</p>
                                                <p> If I bring my Compression down, it will consider areas that aren't
                                                    quite as dark to be shadow also.</p>
                                                <p> So, if I bring my Compression all the way down, it lightens up a lot
                                                    of it, thinking that it's all shadow or highlight.</p>
                                                <p> And if I take my Compression up all the way, it will only lighten up
                                                    the very, very darkest things like these.</p>
                                                <p> I want it to lighten up this area here and maybe this area in here a
                                                    little, so I'll take the Compression from 100% and slowly bring it
                                                    down until it just affects these areas.</p>
                                                <p> Okay.</p>
                                                <p> I think that's about the best I can do with this module.</p>
                                                <p> I usually don't like to use this module at 100% because, later on
                                                    when I start making changes, it tends to show any of the halos that
                                                    came up with this module; they'll be exaggerated.</p>
                                                <p> The most I use is around 50%, so I'll knock this down to 50%.</p>
                                                <p> It helped us.</p>
                                                <p> It doesn't get rid of everything, but we've got multiple ways to
                                                    deal with our shadows and highlights.</p>
                                                <p> That's a good start.</p>
                                                <p> Another way to deal with shadows and highlights is a Lowpass Filter
                                                    with Overlay Blend Mode.</p>
                                                <p> I take my Saturation down to zero.</p>
                                                <p> Then, using my Radius, which is a lot like the Radius on the Shadow
                                                    and Highlights Module, I will adjust my Radius so I get large areas
                                                    without features.</p>
                                                <p> I don't want to see individual trees and things, but I can see this
                                                    area is dark and this area is light, and this area is very light
                                                    here.</p>
                                                <p> So, that was up around 100px; I'm at 92.</p>
                                                <p> Then I take my Blend Mode and change it to Overlay.</p>
                                                <p> Here's the trick: you take your Contrast and start turning it
                                                    negative.</p>
                                                <p> I start with zero.</p>
                                                <p> When it's exactly zero, you shouldn't be able to tell the difference
                                                    between the original and this one.</p>
                                                <p> Yeah, there is no difference: good.</p>
                                                <p> Then, as I take my Contrast negative, these areas that are darker
                                                    will get a little lighter.</p>
                                                <p> These areas that are lighter will get a little darker.</p>
                                                <p> I want to be careful with this because I don't want it to create
                                                    halos either.</p>
                                                <p> So, I'm slowly bringing it negative.</p>
                                                <p> Let's see, 0.3.</p>
                                                <p> So, that's before, and that's after.</p>
                                                <p> We've knocked down our highlights a little and brought out our
                                                    shadows a little more.</p>
                                                <p> That's good.</p>
                                                <p> How is our Exposure? I think we're pretty good here.</p>
                                                <p> We're in the middle.</p>
                                                <p> We're not point to point, but we'll worry about our Black and our
                                                    White Points at the very end of the edit, and I want most of my data
                                                    to be in the mid-tones so that I can bring out relief.</p>
                                                <p> And I've got that: most of my data's in the mid-tones.</p>
                                                <p> This is the end of our first stage.</p>
                                                <p> Then we can apply Denoising and Chromatic Aberration Control and
                                                    Demosaic-ing too.</p>
                                                <p> Now, I see this was shot at 100 ISO, so it will be really hard to
                                                    see where there is and isn't noise.</p>
                                                <p> If we exaggerate the contrast in an area like here, we can look at
                                                    which Denoising strategies yield the best results.</p>
                                                <p> Now this is artificially contrasty, just so I can look at my
                                                    Denoising options.</p>
                                                <p> Okay, what have we got? We can always start with the RAW Denoise,
                                                    which usually gives fantastic effects, but blurs your edges.</p>
                                                <p> Yeah, that makes the water look great, and we lose all our detail in
                                                    here.</p>
                                                <p> If I bring that down to the point where it just works in the water,
                                                    it's a little better here.</p>
                                                <p> Okay, that's at 0.005.</p>
                                                <p> We'll take Snapshots along the way and come up with our best
                                                    Denoising strategy.</p>
                                                <p> Let's look at the standard Profile Denoise, which usually does an
                                                    excellent job -- and it does, look at that.</p>
                                                <p> Oh, look; we still have our detail in the smaller features, but
                                                    we've got much smoother transitions here.</p>
                                                <p> The only thing I don't like about this Nonlocal Means on the Profile
                                                    Denoise is you get these little patterns that look like an artistic
                                                    brush or something, and it's a little bit splotchy.</p>
                                                <p> There's a splotch there and a splotch there.</p>
                                                <p> If we go to Wavelets, that gets rid of the splotches, but it looks
                                                    like we've got a different problem pattern here.</p>
                                                <p> We could probably deal with that with the Equalizer.</p>
                                                <p> Let's see if we bring our Strength down and bring our Equalizer
                                                    Noise Reduction to try and get rid of the small patterns from the
                                                    Profile Denoise...</p>
                                                <p> Okay, so it's a two-step method here, doing the Profile Denoise and
                                                    then the Equalizer to get rid of the remnant pattern.</p>
                                                <p> How does that compare to the RAW Denoise? Well, it's not quite as
                                                    smooth in the water, but it's pretty darn good.</p>
                                                <p> It's a lot better down here in the trees and houses, though.</p>
                                                <p> Okay, so that's our new best one.</p>
                                                <p> I'll take a Snapshot of that.</p>
                                                <p> We'll get rid of these settings and try the Bilateral Filter
                                                    Denoising.</p>
                                                <p> Oh, that does a nice job in the water.</p>
                                                <p> Look at all the detail it keeps down here! ...and in these
                                                    trees.</p>
                                                <p> This seems to be a nice balance between detail and denoising.</p>
                                                <p> That's my new favorite one.</p>
                                                <p> I'll look at the Non-local Means.</p>
                                                <p> Ick! What if we increase the Patch Size? Nope.</p>
                                                <p> Okay.</p>
                                                <p> Alright; I like that Bilateral Filter.</p>
                                                <p> That turned out sweet.</p>
                                                <p> Bilateral Filter it is.</p>
                                                <p> Now I can get rid of the extra contrast that I added just to be able
                                                    to see the Denoising.</p>
                                                <p> Okay: Demosaic.</p>
                                                <p> We're starting with PPG.</p>
                                                <p> Take a Snapshot and look.</p>
                                                <p> Amaze.</p>
                                                <p> I see a little purple fringing here from the PPG, and in these
                                                    windows.</p>
                                                <p> And with the Amaze it's gone entirely, but we don't seem to have
                                                    compromised any detail.</p>
                                                <p> There's purple fringing here that goes away too.</p>
                                                <p> Okay, and with the VNG? The VNG is usually a little soft, and in
                                                    this case it's soft.</p>
                                                <p> And I don't think we need the extra softening that VNG does because
                                                    this was shot at 100 ISO and is such a high-quality image.</p>
                                                <p> So, Amaze it is.</p>
                                                <p> I'm pretty happy with the effect I'm getting with that; I don't
                                                    think that we need to add any Color Smoothing to the equation.</p>
                                                <p> Lastly, Chromatic Aberrations.</p>
                                                <p> A listener wrote in and pointed out an error I've been making in
                                                    Chromatic Aberration adjustments.</p>
                                                <p> In reference to the Darktable Manual, it says here that the model
                                                    only works with an uncropped photographic image, and that when I
                                                    zoom in to the image, I'll get incorrect data.</p>
                                                <p> I shouldn't work that way.</p>
                                                <p> It sounds like I should just turn it on by default, and that it
                                                    works with any camera that uses a Bayer sensor, which this
                                                    particular Nikon does.</p>
                                                <p> So, let's turn it on.</p>
                                                <p> At some point, I want to do an exhaustive study of the Chromatic
                                                    Aberration controls and see how that works.</p>
                                                <p> So, by default, I'll turn it on now.</p>
                                                <p> Okay, this is where I'm at.</p>
                                                <p> I'll save this image with all these changes, then start working on
                                                    tones and guiding the eye through changing the brightness and
                                                    darkness of different parts of the image.</p>
                                                <p> Okay, let's save it.</p>
                                                <p> I'll save it as a TIFF.</p>
                                                <p> Change these values to zero and zero.</p>
                                                <p> I'm working in Adobe.</p>
                                                <p> Here we go.</p>
                                                <p> Alright, here we are.</p>
                                                <p> Let's start working with tonal control.</p>
                                                <p> I'll be using the Tone Curve a lot.</p>
                                                <p> I notice that the top part of this image gets a little dark,
                                                    especially towards the very top, so I'll take care of that
                                                    first.</p>
                                                <p> Let's see.</p>
                                                <p> Okay.</p>
                                                <p> That helps.</p>
                                                <p> It's getting a little bright here, so maybe I'll be a little more
                                                    strategic about my brightening.</p>
                                                <p> There we go.</p>
                                                <p> Now, from this point to here, it also needs to brighten.</p>
                                                <p> Okay, that helps.</p>
                                                <p> I'd like to get some large-scale detail differentiation down here
                                                    because it looks flat, and it's not interesting yet.</p>
                                                <p> Let's look at the Equalizer Tool for that.</p>
                                                <p> One of the ways to use the Equalizer tool so we can visualize what's
                                                    happening is to do a Gamma adjustment and then look at the different
                                                    blend mode operators, so let's do that.</p>
                                                <p> Okay, new Tone Curve.</p>
                                                <p> Do a big jump there so we can see what we're doing.</p>
                                                <p> Okay, now under Equalizer, I'll change my Blend Mode to
                                                    Difference.</p>
                                                <p> Then I can bring up these sliders and see where I'm seeing
                                                    adjustments.</p>
                                                <p> Okay, these are large scale.</p>
                                                <p> This is nice; this is the kind of scale I was thinking of in this
                                                    area.</p>
                                                <p> Let's see the next size down.</p>
                                                <p> Oh, it's getting smaller, but I still think it helps.</p>
                                                <p> And the next size after that? That's getting too small; that just
                                                    gets confusing.</p>
                                                <p> Okay, I want to work on this area in here, right there, with these
                                                    larger sizes.</p>
                                                <p> So, maybe a combination of these two, like that? Okay, that gives us
                                                    a little bit of this hill, and we can see some changes in these
                                                    fields.</p>
                                                <p> So, turn off the Gamma adjustment and change our Blend Mode from
                                                    Difference to Normal.</p>
                                                <p> Okay.</p>
                                                <p> Without it, and with it.</p>
                                                <p> Yeah; we're getting these changes down here from differences in
                                                    tone.</p>
                                                <p> That helps; that gives us more differentiation.</p>
                                                <p> It's easier to see what's going on.</p>
                                                <p> And I only want to apply that down here; I don't want it to go
                                                    everywhere.</p>
                                                <p> I'll use a Drawn Mask.</p>
                                                <p> Let's see: we'll go up here.</p>
                                                <p> Stay away from the water so we don't get any halos.</p>
                                                <p> Now, make it a little smaller and make our Blend Area a little
                                                    bigger.</p>
                                                <p> Bring that down.</p>
                                                <p> That's what it looked like before, and that's what it looks like
                                                    now.</p>
                                                <p> It looks like it's a little heavy, so I'll just bring down our
                                                    Opacity a little.</p>
                                                <p> That helps.</p>
                                                <p> This looks a little light here.</p>
                                                <p> I'd like this hillside to pop from the bottom, so I'll darken the
                                                    hillside and leave the bottom part lighter so it will match this
                                                    area better.</p>
                                                <p> We'll have it go like this.</p>
                                                <p> And bring down our darker areas so we have more relief.</p>
                                                <p> Ah, that looks better.</p>
                                                <p> Before, and after.</p>
                                                <p> Now the planes down here are starting to separate a little and I'm
                                                    starting to get the circle the circle that I wanted, coming in like
                                                    this.</p>
                                                <p> This top part up here and over to here is too light.</p>
                                                <p> That looks better.</p>
                                                <p> Before and after.</p>
                                                <p> Mountain looks a little dark.</p>
                                                <p> We'll get all of these done and then we can work on the relief
                                                    aspect.</p>
                                                <p> Let's see: mountain.</p>
                                                <p> We don't want our mountain to be dark.</p>
                                                <p> I'll make it a little smaller, make our Blend Area a little
                                                    bigger.</p>
                                                <p> Okay.</p>
                                                <p> And let's concentrate on the darker parts.</p>
                                                <p> Here's our spiral.</p>
                                                <p> What have we got? Come up like this and over like this.</p>
                                                <p> This looks good.</p>
                                                <p> I want this to be a little lighter though, because it gets right in
                                                    the middle of our spiral and breaks it.</p>
                                                <p> So, this front rock.</p>
                                                <p> Let's see: Tone Curve.</p>
                                                <p> Another Drawn Area.</p>
                                                <p> I want to add some color to the parts that don't have as much color
                                                    so that we get some of these de-saturated areas.</p>
                                                <p> I'll use a Parametric Mask on the C Channel, which is
                                                    Chromaticity.</p>
                                                <p> I'll turn on the Mask Indicator and bring my two sliders down until
                                                    I start finding my most-saturated areas.</p>
                                                <p> Right there.</p>
                                                <p> Now, this has created a graduated mask, where the parts with the
                                                    least saturation are getting the most effect.</p>
                                                <p> They are the brightest yellow.</p>
                                                <p> And the parts with the most saturation are getting the least
                                                    effect.</p>
                                                <p> Then I'll steepen my A and B Channels.</p>
                                                <p> That's without it, and that's with it.</p>
                                                <p> I think we can use it full strength.</p>
                                                <p> That looks fine.</p>
                                                <p> Our blue's getting a little out of gamut here, but that's just where
                                                    it's going to white, so I'm not actually going to worry about
                                                    that.</p>
                                                <p> And I'm staying on my Histogram on both sides.</p>
                                                <p> Now let's look at adding some tones with our Lowpass Filter.</p>
                                                <p> If I turn off my Saturation, bring the Contrast down a little and
                                                    the Brightness up a little, then adjust my Radius and try to get the
                                                    kind of shadows I'm looking for here.</p>
                                                <p> Let's see: this shows me the sides of the mountain and gives me some
                                                    basic shapes here that are kind of nice.</p>
                                                <p> That's at 27 px, so I'll apply that with a Softlight Blend Mode and
                                                    use the Opacity to attenuate it.</p>
                                                <p> I don't want it to get too dark.</p>
                                                <p> I don't see it helping me up here at all, so I'll use a Drawn Mask
                                                    and just have it work on the bottom part of the image.</p>
                                                <p> That's before, and that's after.</p>
                                                <p> I want to do that again.</p>
                                                <p> Saturation down to zero.</p>
                                                <p> Contrast down a little.</p>
                                                <p> Brightness up a little.</p>
                                                <p> The reason I bring my Contrast down and my Brightness up is so that
                                                    my end result is approximately the same brightness as my starting
                                                    result.</p>
                                                <p> Bring our Radius to the point where we're showing different details,
                                                    like the edges of these hills.</p>
                                                <p> Now, I see when I'm doing that, I'm not getting any detail in these
                                                    clouds, so I don't want to apply it up there.</p>
                                                <p> Once again, I'll use a Drawn Mask and just apply it on the bottom,
                                                    and use Opacity to attenuate it.</p>
                                                <p> Softlight again.</p>
                                                <p> Opacity.</p>
                                                <p> And bring it up.</p>
                                                <p> I'm looking at the sides of the hill and these crevices and these
                                                    shadowy details.</p>
                                                <p> The edges of the waterfront.</p>
                                                <p> I'm trying to come up with a good level of application so I don't
                                                    get halos or too dark of areas but still get nice relief.</p>
                                                <p> That looks good.</p>
                                                <p> And that was smaller: that was at 17 pixels.</p>
                                                <p> Let's try that again.</p>
                                                <p> This time I'd like to get small enough to get these clouds.</p>
                                                <p> I'll bring my Radius down until I start getting details in the
                                                    clouds.</p>
                                                <p> Getting some.</p>
                                                <p> Ah, that looks better.</p>
                                                <p> Now they're looking rounded.</p>
                                                <p> I can see details in these mountains too.</p>
                                                <p> So, that's at around 6 pixels.</p>
                                                <p> Once again, Softlight.</p>
                                                <p> As I bring it up, it looks a little heavy here compared to up here,
                                                    so I'll do a mask going the other way.</p>
                                                <p> A Drawn Mask.</p>
                                                <p> I want to apply it here also.</p>
                                                <p> I just want more of it up here, so I'll make the mask larger.</p>
                                                <p> If I go like that, 100% of the effect will occur from here up.</p>
                                                <p> At this point, it will be about 50% of the effect, and then a little
                                                    lower down here.</p>
                                                <p> Can we turn our Opacity up? Oh, yeah, we can.</p>
                                                <p> That looks good.</p>
                                                <p> The bottom is a little dark still.</p>
                                                <p> I'll make another tonal adjustment.</p>
                                                <p> Okay, reverse the direction.</p>
                                                <p> We'll turn on our Mask Indicator to see where we are.</p>
                                                <p> Then I'll bring this up a little.</p>
                                                <p> Okay, that looks better.</p>
                                                <p> Maybe a little more.</p>
                                                <p> No, that's too much.</p>
                                                <p> The mountain is still a little dark.</p>
                                                <p> That one right there.</p>
                                                <p> So maybe this edge needs to come out further.</p>
                                                <p> Let's take our Blend Radius and make it a little smaller, bring our
                                                    effect out a little more.</p>
                                                <p> We're losing contrast in there but we're gaining brightness.</p>
                                                <p> I'll give it a little S curve here.</p>
                                                <p> Give it a little more punch like that, but then bring down our
                                                    shadows a little.</p>
                                                <p> That's what I'm looking for.</p>
                                                <p> Now I want to bring out more detail.</p>
                                                <p> I'll use the Highpass Filter with the Softlight Blend Mode.</p>
                                                <p> I'll bring my Sharpness way up to try and get some detail like this,
                                                    and around these edges, but I don't want anything to become too
                                                    black.</p>
                                                <p> I'm okay so far.</p>
                                                <p> Let's bring the Contrast up a little.</p>
                                                <p> Oh, that's a little too much there, around these edges.</p>
                                                <p> We'll bring it down.</p>
                                                <p> Okay, now I'll apply that with a Softlight, but I'm not going to
                                                    apply it evenly because in these darker areas, it's just going to
                                                    turn black.</p>
                                                <p> I'll use a Parametric Mask based on the L Channel so that the
                                                    brighter parts of the image get most of the effect and the darker
                                                    parts get none of the effect.</p>
                                                <p> I'll change my Blend Mode to Softlight and use my Opacity to
                                                    attenuate it.</p>
                                                <p> That's with it off, and then I'll bring it up slowly until it starts
                                                    to look like it's too much, then bring it back down.</p>
                                                <p> It's starting to get a little crunchy in here and up here too.</p>
                                                <p> That was at 80%.</p>
                                                <p> And that's at 60%.</p>
                                                <p> So, before and after.</p>
                                                <p> It looks nice up in these clouds and it looks nice on this side, and
                                                    I think we're still good over here.</p>
                                                <p> I'll save it at this point.</p>
                                                <p> Then I'll work on final color and final sharpening and Black Point
                                                    and White Point.</p>
                                                <p> Save it.</p>
                                                <p> Export as a TIFF.</p>
                                                <p> There we are.</p>
                                                <p> I'll use the Multiply Method with my Tone Curve to add more
                                                    color.</p>
                                                <p> If I take a Parametric Mask based on the L Channel and change my
                                                    Blend Mode to Multiply, as I bring up my Opacity, you'll see that as
                                                    I start increasing our Saturation our greens are starting to pop and
                                                    our blues are getting more saturated too.</p>
                                                <p> If I bring it too far, it gets kind of dark.</p>
                                                <p> But I can balance this by using this curve also.</p>
                                                <p> Let's bring up our Midpoint.</p>
                                                <p> I don't want to lose contrast, so bring this down.</p>
                                                <p> Here's before, and here's after.</p>
                                                <p> I like that.</p>
                                                <p> I want to work on some specific colors, but first I also want to add
                                                    some color in large areas.</p>
                                                <p> I can do that with an Equalizer, and also with a Gaussian Blur.</p>
                                                <p> I think the Equalizer is the right tool here.</p>
                                                <p> I'll go to the Chroma Channel and look at these larger areas that we
                                                    know were at this end of the spectrum.</p>
                                                <p> Let's bring up our color.</p>
                                                <p> This gives us color separation based on distance.</p>
                                                <p> This is just a straight saturation adjustment, even though it gives
                                                    me separation by one area to another, like I say based on distance,
                                                    but it applies to all the pixels in an equal way.</p>
                                                <p> We should apply this with a Parametric mask based on the L Channel
                                                    so that the brighter pixels get more of the effect.</p>
                                                <p> Then we can bring our amounts up a little more too.</p>
                                                <p> There we go.</p>
                                                <p> Now our colors are really starting to pop.</p>
                                                <p> This might be too much down here and in here, but I like it up here,
                                                    so I'll use a Drawn Mask combined with the Parametric Mask.</p>
                                                <p> I'll try to have less of the effect down here on the bottom so we
                                                    don't get too crazy with our colors.</p>
                                                <p> Okay, bring down the Opacity just a little.</p>
                                                <p> We're starting to get somewhere.</p>
                                                <p> I want the green to have more impact in here and out here, but I
                                                    don't want it to get too crazy over here.</p>
                                                <p> I think I'll have to use a couple of Graduated Density Curves
                                                    combined.</p>
                                                <p> I'll take one and go from here to here.</p>
                                                <p> I'll turn on our Mask Indicator and take another one and go from
                                                    here to here.</p>
                                                <p> See how it includes all of this area? What I need to do is turn
                                                    these around so they're the opposite of what I want, and then change
                                                    my Drawn Mask Polarity.</p>
                                                <p> Now I get what I want.</p>
                                                <p> Right there.</p>
                                                <p> So, the trick is to turn it opposite and then reverse the
                                                    Polarity.</p>
                                                <p> Now I can look at this color here.</p>
                                                <p> Let's look at an Area.</p>
                                                <p> We'll include the light green and the dark green and everything, but
                                                    not the little lakes.</p>
                                                <p> Then when we look at our color channels we have some distance here,
                                                    and we can create more distance.</p>
                                                <p> We'll bring up our yellow a little at one end but not at the
                                                    other.</p>
                                                <p> Same thing with our green: at one end and not the other.</p>
                                                <p> Let's be sure our colors are still good.</p>
                                                <p> We'll look at our light greens and our darker greens.</p>
                                                <p> Now, lighter greens should be: L and B should be about the same, and
                                                    A should be about half of that, a little bit less than half of
                                                    that.</p>
                                                <p> So, lighter greens.</p>
                                                <p> L and B are close to the same: we've got 56 and 46, and the A is
                                                    about half of that, maybe a little less than half of that.</p>
                                                <p> We could bring up our green a little more, but let's look at our
                                                    dark greens.</p>
                                                <p> Dark greens should be right around in here.</p>
                                                <p> Let's see: we've got a variation.</p>
                                                <p> L is about twice B and B and A are about the same.</p>
                                                <p> Okay, so L is about twice B, and B and A are about the same.</p>
                                                <p> It looks like we've got too much yellow.</p>
                                                <p> Okay, too much yellow.</p>
                                                <p> So, we can bring up our green a little and bring down our yellow a
                                                    little.</p>
                                                <p> It's a little closer to half.</p>
                                                <p> Those are a little closer to each other.</p>
                                                <p> Hmm...</p>
                                                <p>it's still too much yellow and not enough green.</p>
                                                <p> Okay, we're looking a lot better here.</p>
                                                <p> Those colors look a little strong, so, our Multiply that we did
                                                    earlier here, which is 36% -- I'll take that down.</p>
                                                <p> Ah, that looks right, about at 20%.</p>
                                                <p> I want to do more separation of things.</p>
                                                <p> I want the mountains to pop away from the clouds more, and for the
                                                    water and the green and this hill and this side all to pop a little
                                                    more.</p>
                                                <p> I'll use a Lowpass Filter with an Overlay Blend Mode.</p>
                                                <p> I'll take my Saturation down to zero and turn my Radius up so that I
                                                    lose details but keep general shapes, like the shape of the mountain
                                                    and the shape of the inlet, but not the crevasses and the trees.</p>
                                                <p> I'll bring my Radius up.</p>
                                                <p> There we go.</p>
                                                <p> If I bring it up more, I can't see the difference between the water
                                                    and the mountain, so I'll bring it down until I can see the
                                                    difference.</p>
                                                <p> There we go.</p>
                                                <p> Okay.</p>
                                                <p> I've got my major differences here.</p>
                                                <p> Then I'll apply that with an Overlay Blend method and bring my
                                                    Opacity way down because it comes on too strong.</p>
                                                <p> Well, I like it more up here than over here, so I'll use a Drawn
                                                    Mask.</p>
                                                <p> I want it everywhere; I just want more of it on the left.</p>
                                                <p> With that I can bring my Blend up a little bit stronger.</p>
                                                <p> Before, and after.</p>
                                                <p> Highpass for giving me more details.</p>
                                                <p> Bring my Sharpness all the way down and my Contrast until I get just
                                                    the edges I want and no other ones.</p>
                                                <p> Those look good.</p>
                                                <p> Then I'll use an Overlay method with that and bring my Opacity
                                                    down.</p>
                                                <p> That gives me this sharpness in these rocks.</p>
                                                <p> It looks like around 64% was good.</p>
                                                <p> Now things are really starting to pop.</p>
                                                <p> I want this to be a little bit brighter still.</p>
                                                <p> I'll use a Lowpass Filter just in this area, because this is darker
                                                    than I want and this is lighter than I want.</p>
                                                <p> I'll use a Drawn Mask Blend Mode and go around this mountain.</p>
                                                <p> There we go.</p>
                                                <p> We'll give our Blend Distance a little more; make it a little
                                                    smaller.</p>
                                                <p> Now I'll take my Saturation down to zero and bring my Radius up so
                                                    I'm just looking at these large areas: this dark and this light.</p>
                                                <p> There we go.</p>
                                                <p> Change my Blend Mode to Overlay; change my Contrast so it goes
                                                    negative.</p>
                                                <p> There is starting at zero; it should be indistinguishable from our
                                                    original.</p>
                                                <p> It is.</p>
                                                <p> Then, as I bring my Contrast negative, that makes the lighter areas
                                                    a little darker and the darker areas a little lighter.</p>
                                                <p> Here's our before and here's our after.</p>
                                                <p> Perfect.</p>
                                                <p> I'll set our Black Point and do a final sharpening with Unsharp
                                                    Mask.</p>
                                                <p> ...Gamma adjustment...</p>
                                                <p> I want my Black Point up here to be a little lower; this is looking
                                                    a little hazy.</p>
                                                <p> Oh, final adjustments...</p>
                                                <p> Okay: Black Point.</p>
                                                <p> There we go.</p>
                                                <p> See, I've got the spiral that I wanted.</p>
                                                <p> This area breaks away from this area.</p>
                                                <p> We come up in here.</p>
                                                <p> Maybe a little more color in here? A little more pop right in here,
                                                    because that's where my eye is drawn.</p>
                                                <p> So, a little lower blacks, a little higher whites to give me more
                                                    contrast.</p>
                                                <p> Maybe a little brighter as we go toward the top.</p>
                                                <p> My whites are a little too bright; I'll lower my Exposure for the
                                                    whole image.</p>
                                                <p> I want more detail in the clouds.</p>
                                                <p> So, Highpass Filter...</p>
                                                <p> No, I'll use the Equalizer with a Darken Blend Mode.</p>
                                                <p> So, I'll set up a new one and use a Drawn Mask.</p>
                                                <p> I want to do it more in the clouds, so I'll combine that Drawn Mask
                                                    with a Parametric Mask based on the L Channel.</p>
                                                <p> Right now here's a Mask Indicator.</p>
                                                <p> It shows the clouds are getting a lot, and it goes up as we go
                                                    up.</p>
                                                <p> I want to see where I'm working so I'll do an artificial Gamma trick
                                                    again: bring that up so we can see, and switch the Equalizer to
                                                    Difference.</p>
                                                <p> Then, let's look at what differences we make.</p>
                                                <p> There's one.</p>
                                                <p> Oh, that's too small.</p>
                                                <p> Okay, like that.</p>
                                                <p> There we go.</p>
                                                <p> Now let's change it to Darken and get rid of our Gamma adjustment
                                                    and see what our Equalizer did then.</p>
                                                <p> It went from that to that.</p>
                                                <p> Oh, yeah; that's what I'm looking for.</p>
                                                <p> Maybe even a little more.</p>
                                                <p> Now we've got our clouds popping from the background.</p>
                                                <p> Okay, final sharpening: Unsharp Mask, probably around 0.1 Yeah, that
                                                    looks good: 0.1 Looking at this image, I want to double check the
                                                    colors of my clouds.</p>
                                                <p> It looks like we might have some color in the clouds up here.</p>
                                                <p> I'm pretty happy with the rest of the image, but let's look at
                                                    that.</p>
                                                <p> Go to Area.</p>
                                                <p> Oh, yeah; look.</p>
                                                <p> It's a little warm in both channels.</p>
                                                <p> I don't want to change much of anything else, so I'll use an L Mask
                                                    and Drawn Mask combined, and select the clouds.</p>
                                                <p> I'll try to bring them closer to neutral.</p>
                                                <p> Tone Curve.</p>
                                                <p> That should be our last adjustment.</p>
                                                <p> So, we've got a Parametric and Drawn Mask.</p>
                                                <p> First, like that.</p>
                                                <p> Then we'll use our L Channel here to isolate our clouds.</p>
                                                <p> There we go.</p>
                                                <p> Just the brightest areas.</p>
                                                <p> Where does that show up? Oh, look; we're getting some of this blue
                                                    in here too.</p>
                                                <p> I don't want to include that.</p>
                                                <p> Maybe we can do that based on the B Channel? Is there a difference
                                                    between here -- that's 6.4 -- and here -- that's -30 We can
                                                    absolutely use the B Channel.</p>
                                                <p> Bring these sliders over and eliminate the blue sky.</p>
                                                <p> There we go.</p>
                                                <p> Now we're just looking at the clouds.</p>
                                                <p> Perfect.</p>
                                                <p> Give a little Mask Blur.</p>
                                                <p> One pixel ought to be good.</p>
                                                <p> Okay, our A and our B; take our Midpoint out, and bring this right
                                                    where we want it.</p>
                                                <p> We want to bring our B Channel down a little.</p>
                                                <p> Okay, close to zero there.</p>
                                                <p> And our A Channel also.</p>
                                                <p> Take out our Midpoint.</p>
                                                <p> Now we're at zero and zero.</p>
                                                <p> We've got white clouds.</p>
                                                <p> How does that look? Oh, it did look pink before.</p>
                                                <p> That worked out great.</p>
                                                <p> Andreas, thank you so much.</p>
                                                <p> What a beautiful image! Do you actually live here? Or were you just
                                                    visiting? Let us know.</p>
                                                <p> It's spectacular.</p>
                                                <p> Oh, that was fun.</p>
                                                <p> Well, we're doing great.</p>
                                                <p> We've gotten a lot of new subscribers on YouTube.</p>
                                                <p> We're almost up to 600 subscribers.</p>
                                                <p> And people have been asking questions and giving me suggestions, and
                                                    correcting things I've done that weren't correct; this is great.</p>
                                                <p> I want to remind everybody to send me your RAW edits.</p>
                                                <p> I need contributions in order to do them.</p>
                                                <p> Otherwise, I'm going to start doing my own shots again.</p>
                                                <p>(laughing) So, you can click on 'Edit My RAW' here and you can upload
                                                    your files.</p>
                                                <p> It's at weeklyedit.com.</p>
                                                <p> Here at the site you can create playlists, which is really
                                                    useful.</p>
                                                <p> You can do them based on topics or on modules.</p>
                                                <p> If you watch a video here, on the site, don't forget there's a tab
                                                    down here to make it full screen.</p>
                                                <p> You don't have to watch it in the little tiny window.</p>
                                                <p> All the recent posts are here.</p>
                                                <p> There are these resources: there's the LAB Color Reference Chart
                                                    that I've been working on.</p>
                                                <p> My Workflow: I show most of the steps of my workflow.</p>
                                                <p> I should probably keep it up to date with little changes I make here
                                                    and there.</p>
                                                <p> The Sun and Moon Calendar is useful; it's the Photographer's
                                                    Ephemeris.</p>
                                                <p> It helps me figure out when I want to catch the Supermoon.</p>
                                                <p> What else? Shoot With Harry.</p>
                                                <p> Yes.</p>
                                                <p> Come to Hawaii and shoot with me.</p>
                                                <p> We would have so much fun.</p>
                                                <p> We'd go out and take pictures of all sorts of stuff, and talk about
                                                    cameras and talk about editing.</p>
                                                <p> You can sign up here at shootwithharry.com It's an opportunity for
                                                    me to make a little money and you to have fun.</p>
