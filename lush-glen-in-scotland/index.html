                                                    haven't been able to go over in other videos.</p>
                                                <p> Now, this is kind of an unusual HDR image, because I'm making an HDR
                                                    image out of four HDR images: two sets of two -- well, I don't know
                                                    if you'd call them sets.</p>
                                                <p> See, the images I took, I took with an option on Magic Lantern's
                                                    firmware for Canon cameras called Dual ISO.</p>
                                                <p> It enables you to set the amplification for the pixel information
                                                    coming off the sensor chip at different levels for every two
                                                    alternating scan lines.</p>
                                                <p> For instance, the first and second ones were scanned at 50 ISO and
                                                    then the third and fourth scan lines were amplified to 1600 ISO; it
                                                    goes back to 50 ISO for the 5th and sixth scan lines, and then the
                                                    seventh and eighth back to 1600.</p>
                                                <p> The reason it goes two scan lines is because the bayer pattern for
                                                    the color information is a Red-Green-Green-Blue pattern; it's a two
                                                    by two matrix, and if you alternate each scan line, you don't get
                                                    the right color.</p>
                                                <p> So it goes every two scan lines.</p>
                                                <p> There is some pretty fancy software that makes a lot of intelligent
                                                    decisions and gives you very good results.</p>
                                                <p> It's called "CR 2 HDR" I'll show you: cr2hdr.</p>
                                                <p> And all you have to do is give it a file name.</p>
                                                <p> For instance, that.</p>
                                                <p> That will produce, when you run it, a DNG file, which is still in a
                                                    RAW format, so you can do any RAW transformations that you would do,
                                                    like Chromatic Aberration Control, or Raw Denoise.</p>
                                                <p> But the image will be combined, so that you lose a little bit of
                                                    vertical resolution in exchange for merging together the two ISOs
                                                    into a single image.</p>
                                                <p> Now that's a wonderful thing to do when you've got an image where
                                                    there are little tiny branches.</p>
                                                <p> For instance, on these two images I'm going to work with today,
                                                    these little branchesand leaves.</p>
                                                <p> Now, they're obviously going to move in the wind.</p>
                                                <p> So, if I was going to make an HDR image, it would be impossible for
                                                    them to exactly line up.</p>
                                                <p> I attempted to take both of these pictures in a single shot using
                                                    the Dual-ISO option.</p>
                                                <p> But, even shooting at 50 ISO and 1600 ISO, that was not enough
                                                    stops, in addition to the camera's capability, to enable me to
                                                    capture both the sky and the shadows.</p>
                                                <p> So, I'm going to take two images I have from the same place that I
                                                    shot at different shutter speeds.</p>
                                                <p> This first one I shot at a half of a second and I've got detail in
                                                    the stream, but the sky's blown out.</p>
                                                <p> You can see the highlights are clipped over here in the
                                                    Histogram.</p>
                                                <p> The second image, I shot at a sixth of a second, and I have the sky,
                                                    but I definitely do not have any detail in the stream.</p>
                                                <p> So, I'm going to combine these two images with two different
                                                    methods.</p>
                                                <p> They're both quite simple, and I want to be able to compare them and
                                                    show you why I choose the one I do.</p>
                                                <p> Before I get started, there are some things I want to correct for
                                                    before I create my HDR.</p>
                                                <p> Let's start with this brighter image, which was the half second
                                                    exposure.</p>
                                                <p> If I zoom way in, you can see that, where the extreme brightness of
                                                    the sky and the leaves come together, I've got a bunch of artifacts
                                                    and color noise.</p>
                                                <p> I can think of a bunch of reasons for this: the math involved with
                                                    the cr2hdr application could be creating some of the artifacts; some
                                                    of this could be from fresnel distortion around the edges of the
                                                    leaves; it might be issues with the sensor.</p>
                                                <p> The first thing I'm going to do is try a different De-Mosaic-ing
                                                    algorithm.</p>
                                                <p> So, let's do that.</p>
                                                <p> We'll go to DeMosaic.</p>
                                                <p> It has defaulted to Fast PPG, which, in almost every instance, gives
                                                    fantastic results.</p>
                                                <p> Lets try Amaze and see how that works.</p>
                                                <p> Ah, boy, that looks a little better, but we've got some pixels that
                                                    aren't very pleasant to look at now on the edges.</p>
                                                <p> Let's try VNG Four.</p>
                                                <p> Ah, there we go; we've reduced the noise considerably, and we don't
                                                    have those obnoxious pixel squares on the edges.</p>
                                                <p> If I change my Edge Threshold, I don't see any positive effect, and
                                                    if I use different Color Smoothing amounts, I don't see much
                                                    positive effect either.</p>
                                                <p> So, that's it: VNG Four.</p>
                                                <p> Now, let's try correcting for Chromatic Aberrations and see what it
                                                    does for us.</p>
                                                <p> Ah, that got rid of even more.</p>
                                                <p> Here, I'll turn it off.</p>
                                                <p> Since it's a little bit subtle, I'll take a Snapshot.</p>
                                                <p> Then we'll look at the Snapshot with the correction for Chromatic
                                                    Aberrations.</p>
                                                <p> On the right hand side is the corrected, and on the left hand side
                                                    is prior to the correction.</p>
                                                <p> This is a good place to look right here.</p>
                                                <p> See all this red? And now there's less of it.</p>
                                                <p> It doesn't get rid of it, but there's less.</p>
                                                <p> Something I like to do with all my images is reduce color noise by
                                                    applying a 2- or 3-pixel Gaussian Blur to the entire image before I
                                                    even get started.</p>
                                                <p> It doesn't seem to lose much detail and it really helps with color
                                                    noise as I expand Color Contrast later on, during post
                                                    processing.</p>
                                                <p> Let's do that and see if it cleans up some of this.</p>
                                                <p> We'll set our Radius to 3 pixels, apply it only to the Color
                                                    Channel.</p>
                                                <p> Before, and after.</p>
                                                <p> Well, that gets rid of even more of it, doesn't it? Now, we still
                                                    have some obnoxious pixels that are kind of orphaned along the edges
                                                    of some of these, and there's still a little bit of color noise,
                                                    although we've seen a fantastic amount of improvement.</p>
                                                <p> Here's where we started, and here's where we're at now.</p>
                                                <p> Okay, I'm going to use a brute force method now.</p>
                                                <p> I am going to apply a Gaussian Blur to both the Color- and the
                                                    L-Channel of the entire image.</p>
                                                <p> I think that's going to be fine, because we don't have much detail
                                                    in here anyway.</p>
                                                <p> See how fuzzy it is? I'm going to enstantiate another Lowpass Filter
                                                    and I'm going to bring the Radius all the way down to zero, and then
                                                    I'm going to slowly bring it up with my Mouse Wheel until I get rid
                                                    of all that obnoxious stuff.</p>
                                                <p> There we go.</p>
                                                <p> That's right around 0.8 pixels.</p>
                                                <p> Before, and after.</p>
                                                <p> I'm finally happy with that.</p>
                                                <p> Now, there's no reason to apply it to the entire image, so I'm going
                                                    to use a Drawn Mask with a Fountain Fill and select just the sky for
                                                    this Gaussian Blur.</p>
                                                <p> I'd also like to use the Raw Denoise option.</p>
                                                <p> It's my favorite Denoising tool, and I can only use that tool while
                                                    I'm working with RAW format images.</p>
                                                <p> Once I create an HDR, I will not be able to use that; this is the
                                                    time.</p>
                                                <p> Keeping in mind that this image is a Dual-ISO image, the darker
                                                    parts of the image will have been grabbed by the software from the
                                                    1600 ISO parts of the original RAW.</p>
                                                <p> So, I'm going to go to the darkest places and look for my noise.</p>
                                                <p> That would be in the stream here.</p>
                                                <p> What I'm going to do is bring Raw Denoise all the way down so it has
                                                    no effect, and then I'm going to slowly bring it up until I get rid
                                                    of the noise and maintain as much sharpness as I can.</p>
                                                <p> That looks good.</p>
                                                <p> And that loses a little sharpness.</p>
                                                <p> You can see it here on the grass.</p>
                                                <p> If I go up, it gets fuzzy.</p>
                                                <p> That looks like a good compromise there at .002 An awful lot of my
                                                    images end up with this noise threshold: .002 It seems to be a magic
                                                    setting.</p>
                                                <p> I'm going to apply these same settings to that image that was shot
                                                    with a faster shutter speed.</p>
                                                <p> We don't need this anymore.</p>
                                                <p> This was just so I could show you the Dual ISO.</p>
                                                <p> This is the one we worked on.</p>
                                                <p> I'm going to take my History Stack.</p>
                                                <p> Copy All; that will copy all the transformations I did.</p>
                                                <p> I'm going to apply them to the second image.</p>
                                                <p> Paste All.</p>
                                                <p> And now, I'm going to export these two as TIF images so that they
                                                    save all these settings.</p>
                                                <p> Then I'm going to create an HDR image from those.</p>
                                                <p> Darktable is done exporting.</p>
                                                <p> I have my two TIF images.</p>
                                                <p> Here's one from this DNG and here's another one from this DNG.</p>
                                                <p> Before I get started with my second method of creating an HDR, I am
                                                    going to use Magic Lantern's Create HDR image right here.</p>
                                                <p> Now, I made some changes to these two images, but when I select
                                                    Create HDR, it will not include any of these changes; it's going to
                                                    work just from the RAW image.</p>
                                                <p> So, what I'll need to do is create the HDR and then copy all the
                                                    changes I made from the first DNG to create the TIF, and apply it to
                                                    the HDR that's created in Darktable.</p>
                                                <p> So I'll select this one and this one.</p>
                                                <p> Now, this only works with RAW images.</p>
                                                <p> Once you create a TIF, you cannot use this Create HDR Image.</p>
                                                <p> It says "Merge 2 images" Now, I'm going to take this first DNG, go
                                                    to History Stack, Copy All, and then Paste it on this one.</p>
                                                <p> Now we have all our corrections for our Chromatic Aberrations and
                                                    whatnot.</p>
                                                <p> I'm going to take these two TIF images and create an HDR with a
                                                    different technique, and then I'll compare them.</p>
                                                <p> I'm going to do this at the command line.</p>
                                                <p> Now, I mentioned that it doesn't matter that I'm on a tripod;
                                                    getting the two images to line up exactly is still a challenge.</p>
                                                <p> Here's all our images.</p>
                                                <p> These XMP files are just sidecar files that have the module settings
                                                    from Darktable.</p>
                                                <p> Darktable being a non-destructive photo editing program, instead of
                                                    adjusting the original image it creates a sidecar file.</p>
                                                <p> I want to work with these two TIF images: this one and this one.</p>
                                                <p> First thing I'm going to do is align the images.</p>
                                                <p> The application I'm using is called "Align Image Stack" and it's
                                                    available on Mac and Windows and Linux.</p>
                                                <p> I use Linux.</p>
                                                <p> The first program I used for Magic Lantern called "cr2hdr"; that's
                                                    available on all three platforms also.</p>
                                                <p> This software is all freeware, and openly available to download from
                                                    the internet.</p>
                                                <p> Align Image Stack: it takes a parameter -- well, here: there's a
                                                    parameter right here "minus Capital C" "Auto-crop image to the area
                                                    covered by all images" Now, what that will do, is it will align the
                                                    images, and then it will find the area that is common to both, or
                                                    however many images you use, and then crop them all so you don't end
                                                    up with black bars at the top or the bottom.</p>
                                                <p> So, I'm going to use "-C" for that, and then the way that Align
                                                    Image Stack works is, it looks at all your images and then decides
                                                    how to align them so that they all match up, and then it creates a
                                                    second version of those images without compression so that you don't
                                                    lose detail, but it appends something to those images so you know
                                                    they're the corrected ones.</p>
                                                <p> I'm going to use "aligned." and that way it will put "aligned" and a
                                                    (dot)"." in front of all the files that are the created ones from
                                                    Align Image Stack.</p>
                                                <p> And I'm going to tell it to work on all the TIF images.</p>
                                                <p> Now, I don't want it to work on the XMP images too, so, before I do
                                                    that, I'm going to remove the XMP files.</p>
                                                <p> Now I just have these two TIF images.</p>
                                                <p> There.</p>
                                                <p> So, this says: "Use this program Align Image Stack.</p>
                                                <p> Crop all the images.</p>
                                                <p> Append the word 'aligned' and then a dot when you create the new
                                                    images (so I can differentiate them from the originals) and do this
                                                    on everything that ends in TIF" Alright, the processing is done.</p>
                                                <p> Now we have these two images here: aligned and aligned, and they
                                                    both end with TIF.</p>
                                                <p> Now that they're aligned, I'm going to create my HDR using an
                                                    application called Enfuse, another freeware opensource project.</p>
                                                <p> It's available for all three platforms, and is quite a mature
                                                    project.</p>
                                                <p> Enfuse.</p>
                                                <p> Now, I'm telling it to output to a file name.</p>
                                                <p> I'll just call it "enfuse_hdr.TIF" and I want it to do it to all the
                                                    images that start with the word "aligned".</p>
                                                <p> There we are.</p>
                                                <p> That took a while.</p>
                                                <p> It's done now.</p>
                                                <p> It's created this TIF file, and let's look at everything in
                                                    Darktable.</p>
                                                <p> So, here's the HDR image that was created with Enfuse, and here's
                                                    the HDR file that was created with Darktable.</p>
                                                <p> Let's take a closer look at them.</p>
                                                <p> This is the one that was created with Darktable.</p>
                                                <p> This is the one that was created with Enfuse.</p>
                                                <p> This is Darktable.</p>
                                                <p> And this is Enfuse.</p>
                                                <p> I prefer the Enfuse version.</p>
                                                <p> I feel like I get more mid-tones.</p>
                                                <p> I get smoother transitions, and I get a little bit less of edge
                                                    issues, where the dark and the light come together.</p>
                                                <p> This is the Enfuse version.</p>
                                                <p> This is the Darktable version.</p>
                                                <p> We've got a little bit of a halo here.</p>
                                                <p> They're both excellent.</p>
                                                <p> I'm going to use the Enfuse version.</p>
                                                <p> I just wanted to show you that there are a couple of easy ways to
                                                    get there.</p>
                                                <p> So, let's carry on.</p>
                                                <p> Here we are with the Enfuse version.</p>
                                                <p> I want to bring out the shadows and I want to control for these
                                                    highlights, but not too much; I'm not doing too bad on the
                                                    highlights.</p>
                                                <p> And I'm going to worry about the color of the sky at the very
                                                    end.</p>
                                                <p> I think I'm mostly interested in what I can do about the shadows
                                                    right now.</p>
                                                <p> Let's look at the Shadows and Highlights.</p>
                                                <p> If I bring my Shadows up, okay, that looks good.</p>
                                                <p> And if I bring my Highlights from zero, bring them down, you can see
                                                    that I start getting this halo effect in here.</p>
                                                <p> It's darker in the middle and lighter on the edges.</p>
                                                <p> I've got to bring this down until that goes away.</p>
                                                <p> That's right around there.</p>
                                                <p> And I can adjust my Radius, which will adjust how far out it's
                                                    looking at a transition area between where it enhances the shadows
                                                    and where it stops enhancing the shadows.</p>
                                                <p> Right now it's set to 100 pixels.</p>
                                                <p> If I bring it way down, it looks kindof HDR-y; we don't want
                                                    that.</p>
                                                <p> We want something that looks natural.</p>
                                                <p> If I bring it too far up, that doesn't look natural either.</p>
                                                <p> That looks good to me.</p>
                                                <p> And then the Compression.</p>
                                                <p> If I Compress it all the way, then it only works on the very darkest
                                                    regions.</p>
                                                <p> If I turn the Compression all the way off, then it applies it to a
                                                    much larger area.</p>
                                                <p> See, it's bringing out these areas, calling them shadows, and I
                                                    really want it to work on just the darker places.</p>
                                                <p> I'm going to bring up my Compression until that looks natural to me
                                                    too.</p>
                                                <p> There we go.</p>
                                                <p> I've pushed a lot of my data to the mid-tones; that's what I wanted
                                                    to do.</p>
                                                <p> I'm going to be using these mid-tones later on to generate the kind
                                                    of shading I want.</p>
                                                <p> My goals with this image are to bring out the tree and the fence and
                                                    these individual trees in back here.</p>
                                                <p> As a matter of fact, let's look at the very first image and I'll
                                                    show you where I'm headed.</p>
                                                <p> I want to see these trees as individual; I don't want this to look
                                                    like a clump of dark.</p>
                                                <p> I want to see this tree; I want to see this tree, and I want this
                                                    fence to pop.</p>
                                                <p> I don't want this stream to be a mystery; I want to be able to see
                                                    what's going on in it.</p>
                                                <p> And, I don't want so much contrast up here that it's hard to look
                                                    at.</p>
                                                <p> I want my colors to be deep and vibrant because this is a verdant
                                                    scene, and so I'd like my colors to really be vibrant, but I don't
                                                    want to go out of gamut anywhere.</p>
                                                <p> Back to where we were.</p>
                                                <p> So, I've gotten as close as I can to what I'm looking for with the
                                                    Shadows and Highlights Module, so I'm going to take a Snapshot of
                                                    this, and then I'm going to turn it off, and I'll show you another
                                                    technique I like to use for working with shadows and highlights.</p>
                                                <p> I'm going to bring my Exposure down a little bit.</p>
                                                <p> I'd like my Blackpoint to be down lower.</p>
                                                <p> Alright, I'm looking at my Histogram here.</p>
                                                <p> That looks good to me.</p>
                                                <p> Use my Tone Curve, get into the stream here, because this is what I
                                                    want to bring up.</p>
                                                <p> Let's see: right there.</p>
                                                <p>I'm going to grab this point and bring it up a little bit.</p>
                                                <p> I don't want to go too far because I'll skew the whole curve.</p>
                                                <p> Bring down the Whites, recover some of this data.</p>
                                                <p> I'm going to do the same thing again.</p>
                                                <p> Once again, I'm going to go into the stream, use the Eyedropper,
                                                    bring that up a little bit.</p>
                                                <p> So, I've pushed a lot of my data towards the middle here.</p>
                                                <p> I'm good on both ends.</p>
                                                <p> Now, I'm going to use a Lowpass Filter in an attempt to bring out
                                                    the shadows and knock down the highlights in a more natural way.</p>
                                                <p> First thing I'm going to do is bring my Saturation down to zero so I
                                                    can see what's going on better.</p>
                                                <p> Then I'm going to bring my Radius up.</p>
                                                <p> That's about what I'm looking for.</p>
                                                <p> I don't want to get in to the details; I want to keep it to the
                                                    larger images, the larger aspects of the image like this big dark
                                                    area here, and this big white area here, and this big white area
                                                    here.</p>
                                                <p> I'm going to change my Blend Mode to Overlay.</p>
                                                <p> This is the secret mode.</p>
                                                <p> Right now, it's making the dark parts darker and the light parts
                                                    lighter.</p>
                                                <p> See that? And that is the opposite of what I want.</p>
                                                <p> I'm going to take my Contrast and I'm going to turn it negative, and
                                                    I'm going to turn it negative until I get my image pushed towards
                                                    those mid-tones, like this.</p>
                                                <p> So, there we go.</p>
                                                <p> Now, let's look at the result we got with the Shadows and Highlights
                                                    Slider and compare them.</p>
                                                <p> They both move the image towards the mid-tones, but I feel like I
                                                    get a more natural feel using the Tone Curves and the Lowpass
                                                    Filter.</p>
                                                <p> On the left is the Highlights and Shadows Module, and on the right
                                                    is using the Tone Curves and the Lowpass with a Reverse Contrast
                                                    applied with Overlay Blend Mode.</p>
                                                <p> I prefer the second method, so that's the one I'm going to use.</p>
                                                <p> There we are.</p>
                                                <p> What do I want to do to this image now? Well, I'm preparing the
                                                    image for working on it.</p>
                                                <p> Believe it or not, I'm still doing preparations for that, and this
                                                    image has SO much green in it.</p>
                                                <p> I want to separate this fence from the grass; I want the trees to
                                                    pop.</p>
                                                <p> One of the advantages I have is the tree trunks are a slightly
                                                    different color than the green.</p>
                                                <p> Here it especially is, but here --mmmm--- still some, like here? So,
                                                    if I look at the Channel Mixer, there's an option here.</p>
                                                <p> This is wonderful.</p>
                                                <p> It's called Lightness.</p>
                                                <p> This lets you create your own formula for how the L Channel is
                                                    formed based on the information from the Red, Green, and Blue bayer
                                                    cells.</p>
                                                <p> I'm going to start with a Snapshot, and then I can compare my
                                                    changes to the original.</p>
                                                <p> The way I like to do this, is I like to bring up each of the
                                                    channels until they're approximately the same lightness as the
                                                    original, and then use the Slider to see if I'm getting more
                                                    separation or less separation.</p>
                                                <p> That makes the fence pop like crazy, doesn't it? I don't like what
                                                    it does to the greens; I've got way too much contrast there.</p>
                                                <p> So, this has some pluses and minuses.</p>
                                                <p> Look at how it lightens up the stream, too.</p>
                                                <p> That was the Blue.</p>
                                                <p> Let's bring up the Green.</p>
                                                <p> Well, that does a nice job on the greens.</p>
                                                <p> They look nice and smooth, but I feel like I've got LESS separation
                                                    between my items instead of more.</p>
                                                <p> That kind of flattens the image.</p>
                                                <p> Now let's look at the Red Channel.</p>
                                                <p> Once again, this is reconstructing the L Channel information from
                                                    only the Red Channel at this point.</p>
                                                <p> If you have a dark image with a lot of noise, you're going to really
                                                    see a lot of noise when you do this because, on the bayer pattern
                                                    you've got one Red, two Greens, and one Blue.</p>
                                                <p> So, if you only used, for instance, the Red Channel for your L
                                                    Channel, you'll only be using one quarter the information, and
                                                    that's going to really make your noise go crazy if you've got a lot
                                                    of noise in your image.</p>
                                                <p> Enough of that; let's look and compare the two.</p>
                                                <p> Well, that also separates the items I want to separate from the
                                                    background better than the Green.</p>
                                                <p> So, the Red and the Blue seem to do a good job.</p>
                                                <p> I want some of the Green, but I don't want as much as all Green,
                                                    that's for sure.</p>
                                                <p> The question is, how do I want to apportion the information that
                                                    goes into the L Channel.</p>
                                                <p> Now, this is a matter of personal taste at this point, but I'm going
                                                    to start with less Green than anything else.</p>
                                                <p> So, I'm going to start with 0.2 Green, and a little more Blue, so
                                                    I'm going to do 0.3 Blue, and then I'm going to take my Red, and I'm
                                                    going to bring it down until it's at about the same brightness.</p>
                                                <p> Right around there.</p>
                                                <p> Oh, I like that effect.</p>
                                                <p> Okay, see, this tree pops a little bit more; the fence separates
                                                    itself.</p>
                                                <p> I've got all my channels: I've got my Red, my Green, and my Blue
                                                    being used, so that will NOT enhance my noise too much.</p>
                                                <p> I'm going to stick with that.</p>
                                                <p> So, I've reconstructed the L Channel, but what am I going to do with
                                                    this? Well, I'm going to apply this to the original image instead of
                                                    using it fully as my L Channel, and I'm going to apply it with the
                                                    Soft Light, which I use for Tones.</p>
                                                <p> I like to control Tones with Soft Light Blend Mode.</p>
                                                <p> That's none of it, and this is all of it, and it's way too dark in
                                                    the darker parts.</p>
                                                <p> Instead of just applying it uniformly, I'm going to apply it with a
                                                    Parametric Mask, and I want to maintain the ability to have this
                                                    detail.</p>
                                                <p> I'm going to use the Eyedropper Tool, come into the stream, select
                                                    an area there, and then I'm going to exclude that area.</p>
                                                <p> Here, I'll turn on the Mask Indicator.</p>
                                                <p> I'm going to exclude that area from the image.</p>
                                                <p> I want to smooth this transition.</p>
                                                <p> There, that gives me a nice, smooth application of that.</p>
                                                <p> Before, and after.</p>
                                                <p> Now, I'm getting that change, but it's up here in these lighter
                                                    areas, and it's not hurting me in the stream.</p>
                                                <p> Here, let's look at that before and after.</p>
                                                <p> Before, and after.</p>
                                                <p> That's pretty subtle, so I'm going to take a Snapshot.</p>
                                                <p> There we go.</p>
                                                <p> On the right hand side is after, and on the left hand side is
                                                    before.</p>
                                                <p> There we are.</p>
                                                <p> Our stream looks good and I'm getting the effect I want with the
                                                    tree and the fence.</p>
                                                <p> At this point, I am going to save this image because I've made so
                                                    many changes, and when I use Parametric Masks, I want to know where
                                                    I'm starting.</p>
                                                <p> I don't have control over which order Darktable applies modules, so
                                                    this is my way of taking control of that pixel pipe.</p>
                                                <p> I use 16-bit TIFs for all my work.</p>
                                                <p> They seem to work just fine.</p>
                                                <p> Alright, we're done processing, and here's the TIF that was
                                                    created.</p>
                                                <p> As you can see from our History, we're starting from scratch.</p>
                                                <p> I've got all my detail and information into my mid-tones here.</p>
                                                <p> This is great; this is how I like to work.</p>
                                                <p> I'm going to push this information from these mid-tones towards the
                                                    edges in a way to produce a separation of items based on size and
                                                    color and position.</p>
                                                <p> So, let's get started.</p>
                                                <p> My tool of choice are Lowpass Filters.</p>
                                                <p> I just love them.</p>
                                                <p> The first thing I'm going to do is take my Saturation and turn it
                                                    all the way down to zero so I can see what I'm doing.</p>
                                                <p> Now, when I'm applying Tone to large images, I don't want to have
                                                    the image as a whole get darker or lighter, and I find that the
                                                    magic formula for that is to take my Contrast and turn it down to
                                                    0.9 and take my Brightness and turn it up to 0.03.</p>
                                                <p> That allows me to take my Radius, adjust it to where I want without
                                                    worrying about having the image get dark,dark, dark or light,light,
                                                    light; it kindof stays in the middle.</p>
                                                <p> This will be my starting point.</p>
                                                <p> I'm trying to get the larger feature here of the gully itself.</p>
                                                <p> I'm going to apply that with Soft Light, which I use for tones, and
                                                    then I'm going to take my Opacity and lower it.</p>
                                                <p> This is with none of the effect; this is with all of the effect.</p>
                                                <p> I'm going to find the magic point.</p>
                                                <p> This is all a matter of personal taste.</p>
                                                <p> That looks good to me.</p>
                                                <p> Whenever I apply these Lowpass Filters, I'm pushing information
                                                    towards the edges.</p>
                                                <p> I'm going to have to correct for that as I go.</p>
                                                <p> I'm going to take a Tone Curve and I'm going to get in the stream
                                                    here, and bring it up a little bit.</p>
                                                <p> This area's too bright.</p>
                                                <p> I'm going to bring that down a little bit, and I will continue to
                                                    make these changes as I go.</p>
                                                <p> Another instance of a Lowpass Filter.</p>
                                                <p> Once again, I'm going to take my Saturation and get rid of that.</p>
                                                <p> Bring my Contrast down to 0.9 and my Brightness up to 0.03 and now
                                                    I'm going to use my Radius to determine how large of an area I want
                                                    to work with.</p>
                                                <p> That looks good to me.</p>
                                                <p> I'm getting some of the individual parts of the fence here and these
                                                    tree trunks are showing up a little bit, but I'm not getting lost in
                                                    the detail of the grass and the leaves.</p>
                                                <p> Okay? So, once again, Soft Light and I'm going to use my Opacity to
                                                    attenuate the effect.</p>
                                                <p> That looks good to me.</p>
                                                <p> Back to the Tone Curve.</p>
                                                <p> Zoom in to my stream.</p>
                                                <p> Right there.</p>
                                                <p> Bring it up a little bit.</p>
                                                <p> You've got to check it each time, because these values will
                                                    change.</p>
                                                <p> Bring that down a little bit.</p>
                                                <p> These Lowpass Filters with the Soft Light just gobble up mid-tones,
                                                    but they produce these nice, even shades.</p>
                                                <p> Again.</p>
                                                <p> There we go; that looks good to me.</p>
                                                <p> I start with my larger items and then work smaller and smaller with
                                                    my Lowpass Filters.</p>
                                                <p> I like that effect.</p>
                                                <p> I'm starting to get this branch in here.</p>
                                                <p> I'm starting to get some of these branches, getting nice shading on
                                                    the tree.</p>
                                                <p> The fence is starting to come out.</p>
                                                <p> Once again, Soft Light, and use Opacity to attenuate it.</p>
                                                <p> Come back here...</p>
                                                <p> You know the drill.</p>
                                                <p> We get some of these smaller branches now.</p>
                                                <p> I'm just going to leave that like that; that looks good.</p>
                                                <p> No reason to turn down the Opacity.</p>
                                                <p> Okay.</p>
                                                <p> I'm going to add finer-detailed tones with the Highpass Filter
                                                    instead of the Lowpass Filter.</p>
                                                <p> It's a little easier to control for smaller sized objects.</p>
                                                <p> What I do is I take the Sharpness and I turn it all the way up, and
                                                    that gives me actual tone instead of just edges.</p>
                                                <p> I'm going to look for a combination of Sharpness and Contrast that
                                                    will give me shading at the smaller level.</p>
                                                <p> Oh, that looks good.</p>
                                                <p> I'm going to take that and apply that with Soft Light because it's
                                                    still Tones I'm working on.</p>
                                                <p> Bring down my Opacity.</p>
                                                <p> Now I've got some finer-grained tones going on.</p>
                                                <p> I want to enhance the colors that are dull, but I don't want my
                                                    more-saturated colors to go out of gamut.</p>
                                                <p> This is something I like to do with my images in general.</p>
                                                <p> I'm going to do it at this point, and then I'm going to save this
                                                    image and work on it again.</p>
                                                <p> The reason I want to do it at this point is because I don't want
                                                    this setting to affect my inputs later on, so I just want to correct
                                                    for that now.</p>
                                                <p> Here's how I do it: go to Parametric Mask, select the C Channel,
                                                    which is Chromacity -- that's the amount of color, not the
                                                    Luminosity -- and then I'm going to turn on my Mask Indicator, and
                                                    I'm going to pull these down until I start to see parts of the
                                                    image.</p>
                                                <p> There we go.</p>
                                                <p> Now I'm going to take this upper slider and turn it all the way.</p>
                                                <p> And so, this gives me a graduated effect, where the parts of the
                                                    image that have the least amount of color are going to get the most
                                                    of the effect, and the parts that are already very colorful are
                                                    going to get the least of the effect.</p>
                                                <p> Now, what I'm going to do is I'm going to go to my A and B Channel
                                                    and steepen the curves.</p>
                                                <p> That's going to give me a little more Saturation and it's also going
                                                    to separate my colors, which will make different items more
                                                    distinguishable from each other.</p>
                                                <p> I'll turn off my Mask Indicator.</p>
                                                <p> So, here we are.</p>
                                                <p> This is before, and this is after.</p>
                                                <p> You can see it here, in here, really well.</p>
                                                <p> This is before, and that's after.</p>
                                                <p> This gives us a little bit of a pop, but it doesn't take us out of
                                                    gamut on any of the more saturated parts of the image.</p>
                                                <p> I'm going to save this.</p>
                                                <p> Here I am.</p>
                                                <p> It's been saved.</p>
                                                <p> You can see from the History that we're starting new again.</p>
                                                <p> I've applied a lot of tones to try and make these features look a
                                                    little more 3-dimensional and have them separate from the
                                                    background.</p>
                                                <p> I tried to maintain lightness inside the creek; don't let it get too
                                                    dark.</p>
                                                <p> I'm going to work on some issues with this image right now.</p>
                                                <p> I think this fence and this tree on the right hand side are lacking
                                                    separation and punch.</p>
                                                <p> I'm going to use the Equalizer and see what I can do to create a
                                                    little more separation in here.</p>
                                                <p> There are three tabs in Equalizer.</p>
                                                <p> Edges doesn't do anything unless you've applied the Luma Effect.</p>
                                                <p> Until you've increased contrast based on size -- it's kindof like
                                                    local contrast.</p>
                                                <p> If I increase the Coarseness, you can see the larger items have
                                                    higher contrast.</p>
                                                <p> If I go down the line here, you can see it's the smaller items that
                                                    get more contrast.</p>
                                                <p> I want to separate the tree and the fence.</p>
                                                <p> These are larger items.</p>
                                                <p> I'll start on this side and work my way down.</p>
                                                <p> Okay, that helps.</p>
                                                <p> And that helps.</p>
                                                <p> As I get smaller, mmmm, that's starting to confuse things.</p>
                                                <p> Okay, so I'm going to bring these two up a little bit.</p>
                                                <p> I'm not looking at any of this other part of the image; I'm just
                                                    worrying about this item here.</p>
                                                <p> Before, and after.</p>
                                                <p> I'm going to take a Snapshot, and then I'm going to work on another
                                                    method of doing the same thing.</p>
                                                <p> I'm going to use the Lowpass Filter, like we've used before.</p>
                                                <p> Bring my Radius up.</p>
                                                <p> Then, this time, I'm going to adjust my Contrast and my Brightness
                                                    with a very specific goal in mind: to bring these out.</p>
                                                <p> So, I'm going to play with these a little bit and get them so that
                                                    they're doing what I want.</p>
                                                <p> Now, I'm going to apply this with the Soft Light.</p>
                                                <p> Now, let's see how that compares to what I got with the
                                                    Equalizer.</p>
                                                <p> I took a Snapshot.</p>
                                                <p> On the left side is with the Equalizer; on the right side is with
                                                    the Lowpass Filter.</p>
                                                <p> Well, they do different things, and I like them both, but for
                                                    different reasons.</p>
                                                <p> So, I'm going to use both.</p>
                                                <p> I'll use 50% of each.</p>
                                                <p> Take my Opacity down to 50% with the Lowpass.</p>
                                                <p> Take my Equalizer and set it to 50%.</p>
                                                <p> Let's look at before and after.</p>
                                                <p> Before, we'll take a Snapshot.</p>
                                                <p> And after.</p>
                                                <p> On the right hand side is our 50-50 mix and on the left side is
                                                    before we did anything.</p>
                                                <p> Before we did anything, and our 50-50 mix.</p>
                                                <p> Oh, that looks nice and natural, and it's giving me more
                                                    separation.</p>
                                                <p> Now, on the left side here, it's just making everything dark and
                                                    confused; I don't want that.</p>
                                                <p> So, I'm going to apply this effect with a Drawn Mask.</p>
                                                <p> I'll use a Fountain Fill.</p>
                                                <p> I'm going to take the same Mask and apply it to the other effect by
                                                    selecting Drawn Mask.</p>
                                                <p> Then, under Drawn Mask, where it says No Mask Used, I see
                                                    Equalizer.</p>
                                                <p> Well, that's the mask I had before.</p>
                                                <p> Same place.</p>
                                                <p> There we are.</p>
                                                <p> This is before, and after, and it's only being applied to the right
                                                    side of the image.</p>
                                                <p> So: perfect.</p>
                                                <p> That's what I wanted.</p>
                                                <p> Alright.</p>
                                                <p> The top of the image is a little bit too bright.</p>
                                                <p> I'm going to use the Graduated Density, bringing my Density
                                                    down.</p>
                                                <p> This is like a Graduated Density Filter on the front of your
                                                    lens.</p>
                                                <p> If I bring it down to zero, it has no effect.</p>
                                                <p> That's too bright.</p>
                                                <p> Bring it up a little bit.</p>
                                                <p> That's too dark.</p>
                                                <p> That's about what I'm looking for.</p>
                                                <p> I can move this up and down.</p>
                                                <p> I can make other changes, but you know what? That looks like just
                                                    what I want.</p>
                                                <p> So, I'm going to leave that like that.</p>
                                                <p> Alright, this lower left hand corner is just too bright.</p>
                                                <p> I find it distracting, so I'm going to use a Graduated Density
                                                    Filter over here.</p>
                                                <p> Fountain Fill.</p>
                                                <p> Make it a little bit larger so it's nice and smooth.</p>
                                                <p> I don't want the darker parts to get darker; I just want to bring
                                                    down these brighter parts.</p>
                                                <p> That's what I want right there.</p>
                                                <p> Okay.</p>
                                                <p> I still want more separation between these trees and the
                                                    background.</p>
                                                <p> So, I'm going to use a different blend technique with the Gaussian
                                                    Blur called Overlay, and that kindof makes things look a little
                                                    3-dimensional, like they're separated and spaced forward from the
                                                    background.</p>
                                                <p> I'll show you what I mean.</p>
                                                <p> A new instance of a Lowpass Filter.</p>
                                                <p> I'm going to take my Saturation and turn it down to zero so I can
                                                    see what I'm doing, which makes it easier for me to see.</p>
                                                <p> Then I'm going to increase my Radius until it looks like what I'm
                                                    looking for.</p>
                                                <p> Right about there.</p>
                                                <p> Now I'm going to apply this effect with Overlay.</p>
                                                <p> I'm going to have to bring down my Contrast; it's definitely too
                                                    much.</p>
                                                <p> I think that's just what I'm looking for.</p>
                                                <p> These shadows got way too dark, though.</p>
                                                <p> See? So, I'm going to do something about that.</p>
                                                <p> I'm going to apply this effect with a Parametric Mask so that I
                                                    don't have that problem.</p>
                                                <p> If I look inside the stream here, it seems like everything's under
                                                    30.</p>
                                                <p> This number is what I'm looking at here.</p>
                                                <p> I can turn on my Mask Indicator.</p>
                                                <p> Bring this up, mid-20s, and then a nice feathering effect so it's
                                                    not everywhere.</p>
                                                <p> Okay.</p>
                                                <p> Before, and after.</p>
                                                <p> Well, this isn't really helping.</p>
                                                <p> I'm not having enough of an effect on the grass, and so I've
                                                    actually lost some contrast between these items.</p>
                                                <p> I'm going to turn on my Mask Indicator.</p>
                                                <p> Let's try and isolate the stream a little more.</p>
                                                <p> And increase our Contrast a little bit.</p>
                                                <p> There, that's closer to what I'm looking for.</p>
                                                <p> It helped separate these trees a little bit.</p>
                                                <p> We're really starting to be able to pick them out from the
                                                    background.</p>
                                                <p> If you recall, when we started, it was just a mess of shapes back
                                                    there.</p>
                                                <p> Now we're starting to get somewhere.</p>
                                                <p> That was a tricky one.</p>
                                                <p> I'm going to apply some Tones and Edging with a Highpass Filter.</p>
                                                <p> I'm going to bring my Sharpness down -- a lot.</p>
                                                <p> And then bring my Contrast -- there we go.</p>
                                                <p> I've got some edges in here, and just a little bit of tonal
                                                    change.</p>
                                                <p> I'm going to apply this with an Overlay.</p>
                                                <p> I like to do edges with Overlay.</p>
                                                <p> This always comes on too strong, so I'm going to take the Opacity
                                                    and turn it down.</p>
                                                <p> Before, and after.</p>
                                                <p> Okay, we're starting to get some of those edges back that we've been
                                                    losing by using Lowpass Filters over and over again.</p>
                                                <p> That's alright; we'll get it all back.</p>
                                                <p> It'll be fine in the long run.</p>
                                                <p> The sky here: I need to do something about that.</p>
                                                <p> So, I'm going to use the Color Zones and I'm going to take this area
                                                    here and try and make it so that it looks a little more
                                                    believable.</p>
                                                <p> I've got some blue out on the edges here, or cyan; I've got magenta
                                                    creeping in; this area's not very dark.</p>
                                                <p> Okay, I'm going to take a Drawn Mask.</p>
                                                <p> Let's use the Bezier Curves.</p>
                                                <p> I can adjust the area with the Mouse Wheel so I get a nice smooth
                                                    blur.</p>
                                                <p> This is about where I want to adjust my color and my lightness.</p>
                                                <p> Right now I'm on Lightness.</p>
                                                <p> I'm going take this Pull Point and move it over, try and center it
                                                    between these other ones, and let's darken that up just a little
                                                    bit.</p>
                                                <p> So, this is only working on this color.</p>
                                                <p> The Saturation, I want to pull that down; it's definitely too much
                                                    Saturation in this area.</p>
                                                <p> Oh, that makes me happy.</p>
                                                <p> That looks much better for me.</p>
                                                <p> The rocks in the stream are kindof getting lost, so I want to
                                                    brighten up some of the rocks: not too many of them, so that the
                                                    stream's a little more obvious.</p>
                                                <p> I'm going to do that just with a simple Tone Curve, and I'll just
                                                    use a Drawn Mask and create a bunch of little circles.</p>
                                                <p> Make sure that I catch rocks out on the edges so I can see the full
                                                    extent of the stream.</p>
                                                <p> I don't need to be very accurate with this.</p>
                                                <p> Let's bring up our Gamma a little bit.</p>
                                                <p> Before, and after.</p>
                                                <p> Okay, maybe in here a little bit too.</p>
                                                <p> Oh, not that one; that one was too much.</p>
                                                <p> That helps.</p>
                                                <p> This part of the image looks dark, from here to here, including the
                                                    fence.</p>
                                                <p> So, I'm going to do another Fountain Fill and try to correct that to
                                                    some extent.</p>
                                                <p> Hey, there we go.</p>
                                                <p> Time to Save.</p>
                                                <p> Then I'll be working on final color and final Sharpening.</p>
                                                <p> Here we are: Saved and opened again, History Stack is starting from
                                                    zero.</p>
                                                <p> This is the final run; we're almost done.</p>
                                                <p> I want to have deeper colors and I have a trick for getting nice,
                                                    rich colors.</p>
                                                <p> I like to multiply the image by itself.</p>
                                                <p> Here, I'll show you.</p>
                                                <p> I go to Tone Curve and set my Blend Mode to Multiply.</p>
                                                <p> I'm going to get really rich colors.</p>
                                                <p> See that? Really richens everything up, but I don't want to apply it
                                                    to everything because it makes things darker too.</p>
                                                <p> Just adjusting the Opacity makes it so I don't get enough effect out
                                                    here, and it still makes it dark here.</p>
                                                <p> So, I'm going to use a Parametric Mask, and I'm going to work with
                                                    the L Channel, my favorite channel.</p>
                                                <p> Set it from zero all the way up, so that it has no effect on the
                                                    very darkest parts and maximum effect on the very lightest
                                                    parts.</p>
                                                <p> This doesn't give as much of an effect as I want, so I'm going to
                                                    bring this down just a little bit.</p>
                                                <p> Okay.</p>
                                                <p> And, I don't want it to have as much an effect up here, so I'm going
                                                    to have it go from this region to this region, so that this region
                                                    gets the maximum effect.</p>
                                                <p> So, I'm going to make it Drawn plus Parametric, and use a Gradient
                                                    Filter, so there we go.</p>
                                                <p> I want to enlarge it so that it goes all the way from one corner to
                                                    the other, like that.</p>
                                                <p> There; now this Multiply Effect is not occurring very much up here
                                                    at all, and I'm getting pretty much the full effect down here.</p>
                                                <p> I think that's about what I'm looking for there.</p>
                                                <p> I'd like to make it look a little bit sunnier.</p>
                                                <p> There we go.</p>
                                                <p> Steepen my Yellow.</p>
                                                <p> I'd like to do some final Sharpening.</p>
                                                <p> I'm going to use the Equalizer Tool for that, and I'm going to use
                                                    these lower values where things are smaller.</p>
                                                <p> Maybe bring these two up a little bit.</p>
                                                <p> Ah, perfect.</p>
                                                <p> There, now we've got a lot of detail, and more Sharpening.</p>
                                                <p> Nice.</p>
                                                <p> The sky here still needs a little work.</p>
                                                <p> I'm going to use a Drawn Mask to isolate this part of the image, and
                                                    then I'm going to use a Parametric Mask in addition to the Drawn
                                                    Mask to just get the lighter parts of the image, to exclude the
                                                    darker parts.</p>
                                                <p> So, Drawn plus Parametric: there we go.</p>
                                                <p> Gradient Filter.</p>
                                                <p> Get it turned the way I want it, and make it smaller.</p>
                                                <p> Turn on my Mask Indicator.</p>
                                                <p> Feather it.</p>
                                                <p> Give me a little Mask Blur, so I don't have sharp edges there.</p>
                                                <p> Okay, turn off my Mask Indicator.</p>
                                                <p> Let's see what color this is.</p>
                                                <p> This is: it's green.</p>
                                                <p> Ick.</p>
                                                <p> Because your A Channel is Green: negative.</p>
                                                <p> And magenta: positive.</p>
                                                <p> So, a -9 is Green.</p>
                                                <p> Oh, I don't want a green sky, but I don't want to change the color
                                                    of my green here.</p>
                                                <p> So, what I'm going to do is I'm going to look at my A Channel, use
                                                    my Eyedropper.</p>
                                                <p> There it is.</p>
                                                <p> I don't want to move my Center Point.</p>
                                                <p> Oh, I've got some magenta showing up.</p>
                                                <p> You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to flatten this whole curve
                                                    right here.</p>
                                                <p> There we go.</p>
                                                <p> Less magenta, less green.</p>
                                                <p> Take my B Channel.</p>
                                                <p> Let's steepen that.</p>
                                                <p> Before, and after.</p>
                                                <p> Ah, yes; that looks so much nicer to me.</p>
                                                <p> I am pretty happy with that, except that this particular tone right
                                                    here, and here, and here looks a little dark to me, and some of
                                                    these tones in here look like they should be just a little bit
                                                    darker.</p>
                                                <p> So, I'm going to steepen that, and that might be a final
                                                    adjustment.</p>
                                                <p> Alright, I'm going to bring that Median Point up just a tiny bit,
                                                    and then take this Median Point and bring it down a little bit.</p>
                                                <p> Alright, well; that's what I was shooting for.</p>
                                                <p> It looks pretty good to me.</p>
                                                <p> I hope you all enjoyed it.</p>
                                                <p> Thank you.</p>
