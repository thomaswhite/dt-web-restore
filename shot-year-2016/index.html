                                                <p>Aloha and welcome to Weekly Edit's first edition of the new year,
                                                    Wednesday, January 4, 2017.</p>
                                                <p> We are recording this on New Year's Eve, as Hawaii gets ready to
                                                    bring in the new year and chase out the old year.</p>
                                                <p> Harry has a special edit to share with you this week.</p>
                                                <p> It's one from the mountains of Colorado, a midnight hike he took
                                                    with a friend.</p>
                                                <p> It's a single shot, lit only by starlight.</p>
                                                <p> The challenge will be the balance between detail and noise
                                                    reduction.</p>
                                                <p> I hope you enjoy it as much as he has.</p>
                                                <p> (Harry's voice) In this image, I've got really dark mountains
                                                    because they're only lit by the stars.</p>
                                                <p> The area down here, which is a lake, also is brighter.</p>
                                                <p> I have different colors in the sky because of the airglow and
                                                    because of the light from the city of Durango.</p>
                                                <p> So, I need to break this image into three parts.</p>
                                                <p> I'll give the sky one treatment, the mountains another, and the
                                                    water a third treatment.</p>
                                                <p> I've made copies of this image and put them in different directories
                                                    that I've called 'sky', and 'earth' and 'water.' I'll process each
                                                    of them separately and combine them using compositing.</p>
                                                <p> There is a lot of glow here from the city; we'll have to deal with
                                                    that.</p>
                                                <p> And we have a lot of noise.</p>
                                                <p> When I bring out the mountains, it will be a lot of noise.</p>
                                                <p> I'll use this feature called Fusion, which takes various exposures
                                                    and blends them together with an HDR-like technique.</p>
                                                <p> There is Two Exposures.</p>
                                                <p> And you've got this Exposure Shift, too, which lets you push
                                                    this.</p>
                                                <p> I don't know how that will look different from using Three Exposures
                                                    with a different Exposure Shift, so I'll take a Snapshot.</p>
                                                <p> I'll go with Three Exposures for this side and try to match the
                                                    level.</p>
                                                <p> Does it look any different? No, not really.</p>
                                                <p> It looks a little different in the sky, but I'm not going to use
                                                    this sky, so it doesn't really matter.</p>
                                                <p> It looks like it doesn't matter which one I use.</p>
                                                <p> Well, things are brighter.</p>
                                                <p> We've got some sensor noise here.</p>
                                                <p> I can deal with that with a Tone Curve.</p>
                                                <p> We've got a lot of noise in this, a lot of noise.</p>
                                                <p> And these mountains look flat; I want to be able to discern the
                                                    contours in the mountains.</p>
                                                <p> How can I do that? It looks like I should get rid of as much of the
                                                    noise as possible and then work on those contours so that I don't
                                                    exaggerate the noise when I do that.</p>
                                                <p> The Denoise (profiled) gives us this pattern.</p>
                                                <p> I can get rid of some of that pattern by decreasing my Patch Size;
                                                    that helps, but we still have this crazy pattern.</p>
                                                <p> If I turn up the Strength, I can get rid of that pattern.</p>
                                                <p> Right about like that: 2.481.</p>
                                                <p> We're getting this crazy green-red-green-red pattern also.</p>
                                                <p> Maybe we should split off the Color and the Lumanance Channel on
                                                    this Denoising.</p>
                                                <p> So, that Non-local Means I used on the L Channel.</p>
                                                <p> Now I'll knock down this color noise with a separate instance.</p>
                                                <p> I'll use Wavelets for that.</p>
                                                <p> Now we'll do that on the Color Channel.</p>
                                                <p> We can probably knock down the Strength some.</p>
                                                <p> Whoa: too much.</p>
                                                <p> We still have this leftover gunk.</p>
                                                <p> I don't think I can get rid of it.</p>
                                                <p> Even when I turn up the Strength, it doesn't go away.</p>
                                                <p> I don't see any improvement past 1.7, so I'll leave it there.</p>
                                                <p> I will deal with this separately.</p>
                                                <p> Maybe I can use the Equalizer to get rid of some of that.</p>
                                                <p> Let's see.</p>
                                                <p> Yeah, that gets rid of some of it.</p>
                                                <p> Maybe some of it's in the Color Channel.</p>
                                                <p> That didn't go away.</p>
                                                <p> Let's try Lowpass Filter.</p>
                                                <p> Set the Radius way down, and bring it up slowly until we get rid of
                                                    that noise.</p>
                                                <p> There we go.</p>
                                                <p> Now the noise is blended in.</p>
                                                <p> I'll see if I can just apply that to the Color Channel.</p>
                                                <p> No, I've still got it in there.</p>
                                                <p> It looks better, there's less of it, but it's not all gone.</p>
                                                <p> One more pass.</p>
                                                <p> I'll make the Radius as small as possible: 1.2px.</p>
                                                <p> That will make everything soft.</p>
                                                <p> It gets rid of a lot of the noise, though.</p>
                                                <p> I'll turn on Hot Pixel detection.</p>
                                                <p>Detect by 3 Neighbors is the way to go.</p>
                                                <p> I'll turn on Chromatic Aberrations correction.</p>
                                                <p> Now I'll save this.</p>
                                                <p> Hopefully, that will give me a lower-noise version to work with.</p>
                                                <p> Then I'll work on enhancing contours and things like that.</p>
                                                <p> Okay, I put it in the right place: Reflections/earth TIFF.</p>
                                                <p> Create Unique Filename.</p>
                                                <p> I'm working in Adobe.</p>
                                                <p> Export.</p>
                                                <p> Okay, let's see what we can do with this.</p>
                                                <p> There is a lot less noise now: good.</p>
                                                <p> Maybe the Equalizer can help us bring out some of these details in
                                                    here.</p>
                                                <p> Okay, that looks pretty good.</p>
                                                <p> I can increase the Edges on some of these.</p>
                                                <p> That gets a little more definition.</p>
                                                <p> Maybe a little color too? Nice.</p>
                                                <p> Oh, I want to do something about this sensor noise here.</p>
                                                <p> I don't worry about this sensor noise down here; I'm only working on
                                                    the mountains right now.</p>
                                                <p> That looks better.</p>
                                                <p> Good.</p>
                                                <p> I want to see more contours in the mountains and bring out more
                                                    shapes.</p>
                                                <p> I think the Lowpass Filter is our best bet.</p>
                                                <p> Set the Saturation down to zero and get my Radius so I get the
                                                    features I want.</p>
                                                <p> Softlight Blend Mode is the ticket.</p>
                                                <p> That's before, and that's after.</p>
                                                <p> Now my valleys look a little deeper.</p>
                                                <p> I want more contrast.</p>
                                                <p> I should finish sharpening and then add contrast, because the
                                                    sharpening will add SOME contrast.</p>
                                                <p> I'll bring out a little more contours and features with the Highpass
                                                    Filter, then I'll use a Highpass Filter to add some contrast
                                                    too.</p>
                                                <p> For the contours, I'll just use an L-Mask with a Softlight Blend
                                                    Mode.</p>
                                                <p> What I'm doing is bringing out these little rounded areas.</p>
                                                <p> You can see the size of the features that I'm accentuating.</p>
                                                <p> Then, with the Softlight, it adds these tones.</p>
                                                <p> That's before, and that's after.</p>
                                                <p> It gives me a little more of these fine-grained tones.</p>
                                                <p> Now the sharpening part.</p>
                                                <p> I want to bring my Sharpness way down until I'm just getting the
                                                    sizes I want, like these little rocks.</p>
                                                <p> Then I'll bring my Contrast down so I'm not getting any of that
                                                    noise.</p>
                                                <p> I'm just looking for edges.</p>
                                                <p> The trick here is the Overlay Method.</p>
                                                <p> Then I'll have to turn down the Opacity; it's too much.</p>
                                                <p> Right about there: 32%.</p>
                                                <p> What else? It's a little too bright.</p>
                                                <p> It's night time, so it should be dark, not light.</p>
                                                <p> This is awfully light back here.</p>
                                                <p> I'll take care of this first, and then worry about how light the
                                                    whole thing is.</p>
                                                <p> That looks better.I don't really care about the sky because I'm not
                                                    using this sky.</p>
                                                <p> It's still a little bright right in here, like it could have a
                                                    little more contrast.</p>
                                                <p> I'll do another instance.</p>
                                                <p> That looks better to me.</p>
                                                <p> The whole thing is a little bright, so I'll bring this down a
                                                    little.</p>
                                                <p> There we go; that looks more like a night time shot.</p>
                                                <p> So, I'll crop it so we've just got the part we want.</p>
                                                <p> I think that's as good as we'll get.</p>
                                                <p> Okay, let's start on the sky.</p>
                                                <p> Base Curve.</p>
                                                <p> Do we want to use any of this Fusion? I don't know; let's see.</p>
                                                <p> That looks pretty cool.</p>
                                                <p> I'll take a Snapshot.</p>
                                                <p> Change that to None and compare.</p>
                                                <p> I think the original is better (laughing).</p>
                                                <p> I've got more delineation between the Milky Way and the rest of the
                                                    sky on the original.</p>
                                                <p> I've got vignetting up here in the corners from my lens.</p>
                                                <p> I made a Preset for my lens that gets rid of most of it.</p>
                                                <p> It has this size and shape, and then it adds a little Brightness and
                                                    keeps the Saturation at 1.000 It looks like I could use a little
                                                    more Brightness on this one, so I pushed it up to 0.200.</p>
                                                <p> These lights of the city down here are too bright.</p>
                                                <p> Let's knock them down before we do anything else.</p>
                                                <p> Probably centered right about there Let's concentrate on this, right
                                                    there Uh-oh; this starts to look dark.</p>
                                                <p> Alright, I've added back in a little contrast and knocked down the
                                                    brightness a little.</p>
                                                <p> Speaking of brightness, the center of the Milky Way looks a little
                                                    bright to me, so I'll knock that down too.</p>
                                                <p> There we go.</p>
                                                <p> One of the things I'd like to do is: some of these bigger stars got
                                                    totally burned out.</p>
                                                <p> See that? I want to get rid of the fringing around the outside, this
                                                    purple fringing, and make these larger stars a little smaller.</p>
                                                <p> So, Lowpass Filter.</p>
                                                <p> Now, for the fringing: I'll use a Parametric Mask.</p>
                                                <p> That fringing has got an awful deep color, so I'll use the C
                                                    Channel.</p>
                                                <p> Turn on the Mask Indicator to see where I'm at.</p>
                                                <p> Then I'll bring up these levels until only the most colorful parts
                                                    of the image are selected.</p>
                                                <p> See? It's got this down here too; I don't want to select that.</p>
                                                <p> So, I'll combine it with a Drawn Mask and select this area.</p>
                                                <p> Then reverse that.</p>
                                                <p> Oh, it looks like I need to go out a little more.</p>
                                                <p> Then a little Mask Blur around these.</p>
                                                <p> Like that.</p>
                                                <p> I'll turn off our Mask Indicator.</p>
                                                <p> We've got these bright purples: that's what we're trying to
                                                    affect.</p>
                                                <p> So I'll turn my Saturation way down -- way, way, way, way down, like
                                                    zero; that sounds good.</p>
                                                <p> Hmmm...</p>
                                                <p> I still have quite a bit of purple in here.</p>
                                                <p> I can take my Saturation negative.</p>
                                                <p> That gets rid of it: perfect! Now our fringing is in check.</p>
                                                <p> Did that affect our Milky Way in a negative way? No: good.</p>
                                                <p> Now for these larger stars: let's fix them.</p>
                                                <p> Oh, look; we still have some of this purple here.</p>
                                                <p> I'll bring down this bottom one a little to see if I can pick that
                                                    up.</p>
                                                <p> It should be picking it up.</p>
                                                <p> That's about as good as I'll get with that.</p>
                                                <p> So, another version of the Lowpass Filter, and this time I'll set my
                                                    Radius to, like, one and a half pixels or so.</p>
                                                <p> That fills in the inside of the star with the color around the
                                                    edge.</p>
                                                <p> Now I'll change my Blend method to Darken only, so it won't affect
                                                    the outside.</p>
                                                <p> It just affects the insides of these stars.</p>
                                                <p> And I don't want to do it on the smaller stars; I just want to do it
                                                    on the brighter stars.</p>
                                                <p> I'll use this with a Parametric Mask based on the L Channel and then
                                                    I'll select for the brighter stars.</p>
                                                <p> There they are.</p>
                                                <p> Give it a little Mask Blur.</p>
                                                <p> A couple of pixels there.</p>
                                                <p> There we go; that knocks down these bigger stars a little.</p>
                                                <p> Okay, before we started messing around, we had this purple fringing
                                                    and these bigger stars were burned out in the middle.</p>
                                                <p> Afterward, we've knocked down our fringing and our stars look
                                                    better.</p>
                                                <p> That worked out pretty well.</p>
                                                <p> Let's do a Highpass and see if we can bring up some of these lighter
                                                    stars.</p>
                                                <p> I want to avoid the brighter stars, so once again I'll use a
                                                    Parametric Mask based on the L Channel, turn on my Mask
                                                    Indicator.</p>
                                                <p> This time I'm excluding the brighter stars instead of specifically
                                                    including them.</p>
                                                <p> So, this is where I'm at.</p>
                                                <p> I'll give it a little bit of a Mask Blur, not much: half a
                                                    pixel.</p>
                                                <p> Then I want to increase the Sharpness for these smaller stars, but
                                                    not the noise.</p>
                                                <p> There we go: like that.</p>
                                                <p> Then I'll use Overlay Blend Mode.</p>
                                                <p> Let's see what that looks like.</p>
                                                <p> I might need a little more Contrast here.</p>
                                                <p> That's bringing up the noise too; I don't want to do that.</p>
                                                <p> If I can exclude the sky but include the lighter stars, that would
                                                    be better.</p>
                                                <p> Then maybe a little Mask Blur.</p>
                                                <p> If this doesn't work, I won't do it at all.</p>
                                                <p> I'm not getting good results with that.</p>
                                                <p> Try the Equalizer.</p>
                                                <p> Okay, we'll bring that up a little.</p>
                                                <p> Once again, I want to exclude the brighter stars.</p>
                                                <p> Let's see if we can do that.</p>
                                                <p> That's probably messing with the Milky Way, isn't it? Right in the
                                                    middle.</p>
                                                <p> Does that do anything, though? Did that hurt the Milky Way at all?
                                                    No, it doesn't.</p>
                                                <p> Okay.</p>
                                                <p> Then I want to knock down this noise some.</p>
                                                <p> Maybe we can do that right here.</p>
                                                <p> Oh, that looks better.</p>
                                                <p> A little bit of this Chroma noise too.</p>
                                                <p> Okay.</p>
                                                <p> The Milky Way still looks good too.</p>
                                                <p> I want to get a little more impact on the Milky Way itself now.</p>
                                                <p> I'll do another instance of the Equalizer, and I want to work on
                                                    these larger values here.</p>
                                                <p> That brings out these larger structures of the Milky Way, too:
                                                    nice.</p>
                                                <p> And how about this next one up? Oh, that looks good too.</p>
                                                <p> Maybe the Chroma also? That looks good.</p>
                                                <p> The Milky Way is looking pretty gold to me.</p>
                                                <p> I think it needs to be more blue.</p>
                                                <p> I'll knock this down some.</p>
                                                <p> There we go.</p>
                                                <p> That's starting to be more of what I'm looking for.</p>
                                                <p> And I think we can go a little brighter.</p>
                                                <p> Oh, I don't want it to look too crunchy.</p>
                                                <p> Hey, that looks good.</p>
                                                <p> As a matter of fact, I wonder if I could get deeper colors and knock
                                                    down my highlights by just using a Subtract method instead.</p>
                                                <p> We'll use a Parametric Mask based on the L Channel.</p>
                                                <p> Turn down our Opacity.</p>
                                                <p> Use Subtract.</p>
                                                <p> And bring this up slowly.</p>
                                                <p> That knocks down our high end.</p>
                                                <p> That looks pretty good; I think I like that even better.</p>
                                                <p> And our noise looks pretty good.</p>
                                                <p> Our stars look good.</p>
                                                <p> Our fringing looks pretty good.</p>
                                                <p> And we've got color.</p>
                                                <p> I'll turn on Chromatic Aberration control and Hot Pixels, and Export
                                                    this one.</p>
                                                <p> Reflections.</p>
                                                <p> This one's going into 'sky' Same thing: TIFF, 16-bit, go.</p>
                                                <p> Now, the last one is the water.</p>
                                                <p> Reflections.</p>
                                                <p> Water.</p>
                                                <p> Okay, Base Curve.</p>
                                                <p> Let's look at our Fusion here.</p>
                                                <p> Two Exposures, and Exposure Shift.</p>
                                                <p> Oh, nice: I can see the Milky Way nicely in the water now.</p>
                                                <p> I don't care about the sky and I don't care about the mountains; I
                                                    only care about the water in this one.</p>
                                                <p> I want to show the Milky Way more; I want to control noise.</p>
                                                <p> Yeah; there's a bunch of noise.</p>
                                                <p> Let's see what we can do about the noise first.</p>
                                                <p> Now, this one doesn't have sharp edges because it's in the
                                                    water.</p>
                                                <p> Maybe we can get by with the Wavelets.</p>
                                                <p> That gives a real shiny look.</p>
                                                <p> Can we bring down the Strength some and still be okay? That's the
                                                    limit.</p>
                                                <p> Then can we use the Equalizer to finish? No, maybe not.</p>
                                                <p> Well, we know we can do it with the Lowpass Filter.</p>
                                                <p> 1.8px Alright.</p>
                                                <p> Let's try to bring out the Milky Way.</p>
                                                <p> Oh, that works.</p>
                                                <p> So does that: nice.</p>
                                                <p> And that one too: great.</p>
                                                <p> Okay, how about on Color? Then I want some Edges too.</p>
                                                <p> This is looking better down here; I like it.</p>
                                                <p> Now, we had to make a color adjustment to the sky, so we should make
                                                    a similar color adjustment to the water because it has the Milky Way
                                                    in it.</p>
                                                <p> Like that; that looks good.</p>
                                                <p> Maybe we could make this a little brighter still? Oh, I'm afraid
                                                    I'll lose these stars if I do that.</p>
                                                <p> Tone Curve maybe? Let's see.</p>
                                                <p> Then, this looks a little bright towards this end, so another Tone
                                                    Curve with a Drawn Mask.</p>
                                                <p> Bring this down a little.</p>
                                                <p> Oh, there we go; it was almost like I had to squint when I was
                                                    looking at it.</p>
                                                <p> That's looking better.</p>
                                                <p> We've got our noise under control.</p>
                                                <p> Let's turn on our Hot Pixels and Chromatic Aberrations control and
                                                    Export that one too.</p>
                                                <p>It is going into 'water' (Mouse's Voice) This week I'd like to share
                                                    with you another Island photographer.</p>
                                                <p> This woman, Leslie Gleim, is not just a photographer; she's an
                                                    artist who uses photography.</p>
                                                <p> That distinction is what sets her apart.</p>
                                                <p> She inspires me.</p>
                                                <p> She makes me look at her work.</p>
                                                <p> This was her New Year's shot.</p>
                                                <p> A depth, a complexity, a simplicity.</p>
                                                <p> I really enjoy her work.</p>
                                                <p> Check her out; she's only on Facebook.</p>
                                                <p> She doesn't have a website.</p>
                                                <p> Leslie Gleim Photography.</p>
                                                <p> Enjoy it.</p>
                                                <p> (Harry's voice) Let's take a look at our exports and make sure
                                                    everything is good.</p>
                                                <p> First, we can crop this: we only need the water.</p>
                                                <p> Our black level looks good; our colors look good.</p>
                                                <p> I bet we can get a little more color in here.</p>
                                                <p> There we go; that looks better.</p>
                                                <p> I think I'm good to go on this one.</p>
                                                <p> Let's look at our 'earth' one.</p>
                                                <p> It looks like there's not much contrast.</p>
                                                <p> Okay, one more, just a simple contrast.</p>
                                                <p> There we go: like that, and like that.</p>
                                                <p> I don't want it to be black.</p>
                                                <p> Okay, I think that's about it; it's about all I can do.</p>
                                                <p> Maybe I can bring that down a little.</p>
                                                <p> Oh, there we go, that looks a little more night-like.</p>
                                                <p> Okay.</p>
                                                <p> We'll export this one first.</p>
                                                <p> It will go here: .config/darktable/watermarks I'll save it as this
                                                    tmp.jpg here.</p>
                                                <p> I've got a pre-set I call Watermark that saves it there as
                                                    tmp.jpg.</p>
                                                <p> I've got to change that to Overwrite.</p>
                                                <p> 93? We'll see what size it is.</p>
                                                <p> And I'll leave these sizes the same.</p>
                                                <p> I might be able to increase this.</p>
                                                <p> Okay, I've got a little script here.</p>
                                                <p> Here's what it looks like.</p>
                                                <p> It just looks for the most recent file that starts with tmp and
                                                    converts that with Inkscape to tmp.svg That's all.</p>
                                                <p> Then it reports back the size.</p>
                                                <p> We'll run that.</p>
                                                <p> Oh: 1.2M We can have that be a lot larger.</p>
                                                <p> Let's see if we can increase the quality all the way.</p>
                                                <p> Don't forget to Overwrite.</p>
                                                <p> Yes! Great.</p>
                                                <p> Now we'll go to our original image here, with the sky.</p>
                                                <p> We want the Watermark module.</p>
                                                <p> Here's our file.</p>
                                                <p> Let's bring it down a little.</p>
                                                <p> We'll set our Opacity down so we can do some aligning.</p>
                                                <p> That looks like the hot ticket right there.</p>
                                                <p> Now we'll use a Parametric Mask to separate it from the
                                                    background.</p>
                                                <p> Let's see: Blend method; Parametric Mask.</p>
                                                <p> You know, sometimes it's nice to use the Gray scale instead of the
                                                    Luminance Channel.</p>
                                                <p> The Gray scale is based on a mixture of red green and blue that
                                                    isn't equal amounts of each.</p>
                                                <p> I don't know that it really matters a lot of times, but where it can
                                                    really make a difference is that it goes from zero to 255, and the L
                                                    one only goes from zero to 100.</p>
                                                <p> You get finer granularity with the Gray.</p>
                                                <p> So, when you get to the end, here, and you have very few numbers to
                                                    work with, sometimes it's better to use that.</p>
                                                <p> Let's see what the Mask looks like.</p>
                                                <p> Well, that looks pretty good.</p>
                                                <p> These look awful bright.</p>
                                                <p> Let's give us a little blend there.</p>
                                                <p> I don't want to include this area here, so I'll combine this with a
                                                    Drawn Mask and just draw this out.</p>
                                                <p> There, that looks better.</p>
                                                <p> These mountains are awful bright.</p>
                                                <p> Let's go back and fix the original.</p>
                                                <p> Folder.</p>
                                                <p> Reflections.</p>
                                                <p> Earth.</p>
                                                <p> Let's make these darker back here.</p>
                                                <p> Tone Curve.</p>
                                                <p> And Drawn Mask.</p>
                                                <p> Let's try that.</p>
                                                <p> I want these darks to come down the most.</p>
                                                <p> Maybe I can bring this down a little bit too.</p>
                                                <p> I don't want to lose contrast back there but it's so bright...</p>
                                                <p> That's a little better.</p>
                                                <p> Let's hit it again.</p>
                                                <p> It's starting to look more like night time back there.</p>
                                                <p> Now look: my Black Point is so off.</p>
                                                <p> Let's see if we can fix that for the whole image.</p>
                                                <p> There we go.</p>
                                                <p> Alright, that's looking more like a night time scene.</p>
                                                <p> Overwrite.</p>
                                                <p> Now we'll go back to our sky.</p>
                                                <p> Did that replace it? Yeah, it did replace it with the new one,
                                                    automatically: nice.</p>
                                                <p> That's sweet how that works.</p>
                                                <p> It still looks a little bright on top, so I'll feather this to get
                                                    all of the pasting down here and then it drops off on top.</p>
                                                <p> Maybe I can get rid of this and instead use this, like this.</p>
                                                <p> That's what our Mask looks like.</p>
                                                <p> Yeah, maybe like that.</p>
                                                <p> Well, that looks pretty natural.</p>
                                                <p> That helps with our transition here, too.</p>
                                                <p> I'm happy with that.</p>
                                                <p> Now all I have to do is save this and paste in the water.</p>
                                                <p> I'll save this into the directory it's in now.</p>
                                                <p> Reflctions.</p>
                                                <p> Sky.</p>
                                                <p> Tell it to give it a unique filename so it doesn't overwrite our
                                                    original.</p>
                                                <p> And it's a TIFF.</p>
                                                <p> Export.</p>
                                                <p> Let's get our water portion.</p>
                                                <p> We'll create this one into a Watermark now.</p>
                                                <p> Set the quality all the way up.</p>
                                                <p> Since it's cropped, it might be just fine with that.</p>
                                                <p> Oh, I should have hit Overwrite, just to keep my directory clean,
                                                    but my code works either way.</p>
                                                <p> That WAS under 8M Nice.</p>
                                                <p> Sky.</p>
                                                <p> There we go.</p>
                                                <p> So, we'll grab our most recent one here, which has our
                                                    mountains.</p>
                                                <p> Let's put our water in.</p>
                                                <p> There we go.</p>
                                                <p> Now we just need to not include the shoreline.</p>
                                                <p> How are we going to do that? I guess we can use the L or G
                                                    Channel.</p>
                                                <p> Let's try and exclude that.</p>
                                                <p> What does our shoreline look like here? That is not giving us enough
                                                    differential, is it? Ah, that works better.</p>
                                                <p> Okay.</p>
                                                <p> Then I want to exclude all of this stuff.</p>
                                                <p> So, I'll combine it with a Drawn Mask and paint over this so it
                                                    doesn't include it.</p>
                                                <p> There we go.</p>
                                                <p> Reverse the polarity on that.</p>
                                                <p> Nice.</p>
                                                <p> We've got our shore edge here.</p>
                                                <p> I'll give that a little Mask Blur so it fades in.</p>
                                                <p> That worked out great.</p>
                                                <p> I'm getting a little bit of an edge up here.</p>
                                                <p> See that? I'll add more.</p>
                                                <p> I can make this one bigger because I don't have to be right along
                                                    the shore.</p>
                                                <p> There we go: perfect.</p>
                                                <p> Now I'll just do a second instance without an L Channel and catch
                                                    this bottom part.</p>
                                                <p> So, I'll Duplicate Instance and get rid of the Parametric Mask part,
                                                    and just do a Drawn Mask.</p>
                                                <p> And we don't want these ones; we want this bottom part.</p>
                                                <p> We can make that smaller.</p>
                                                <p> There we go.</p>
                                                <p> Okay, now we've got our water, and we've got our mountains, and
                                                    we've got our sky.</p>
                                                <p> Everything is put together.</p>
                                                <p> Let's do some final processing.</p>
                                                <p> I'm going to Export it so that everything gets pushed together as a
                                                    TIFF and once again Create Unique Filename.</p>
                                                <p> I'll put it in the directory I'm working in, not the Watermark
                                                    directory.</p>
                                                <p> Here we are with our combined image.</p>
                                                <p> Now, let's do final touches.</p>
                                                <p> This part of the sky looks really dark.</p>
                                                <p> I want to do something about that.</p>
                                                <p> As a matter of fact, this whole top part looks pretty dark too.</p>
                                                <p> Well, it looks like I'll be using the Tone Curve for a while
                                                    here.</p>
                                                <p> We'll hit these one at a time.</p>
                                                <p> Make these blend areas big.</p>
                                                <p> Too much.</p>
                                                <p> Okay, that helps some.</p>
                                                <p> Now the whole top looks like it's dark.</p>
                                                <p> Let's see what it looks like.</p>
                                                <p> This part here looks a little dark, and getting too colorful at the
                                                    same time.</p>
                                                <p> As a matter of fact, this whole top does.</p>
                                                <p> Okay, so I'll make it a little brighter, but turn off Automatic and
                                                    put it on Manual.</p>
                                                <p> That will de-saturate it a little.</p>
                                                <p> That helps with that saturation issue.</p>
                                                <p> This looks a little low-contrast -- like the Black Point is off,
                                                    right in this part.</p>
                                                <p> This is all the kind of stuff that's really nice to do in the GIMP
                                                    with the stylus.</p>
                                                <p> Oh, this is starting to look better.</p>
                                                <p> This looks a little dark down here too.</p>
                                                <p> Reverse the direction and bring this up.</p>
                                                <p> Wow, that was really dark down there.</p>
                                                <p> Okay, how are we looking? It looks like this, right from here in
                                                    here could be a little lower contrast, like the brighter parts are a
                                                    little too bright and the darker parts are a little too dark.</p>
                                                <p> Right about like that.</p>
                                                <p> Okay.</p>
                                                <p> Mask Indicator.</p>
                                                <p> And we need to go to our Mask Manager.</p>
                                                <p> Cleanup Unused Shapes and this is Tone Curve #5, so we'll change the
                                                    first one to Union and the second one to Intersection.</p>
                                                <p> Then our Mask Indicator should show us...</p>
                                                <p> There we go; that's the area I wanted.</p>
                                                <p> Okay.</p>
                                                <p> Now I want to bring this up and this down.</p>
                                                <p> Bring that up just a little.</p>
                                                <p> And this green part here down.</p>
                                                <p> Okay, that's looking better.</p>
                                                <p> This is looking overly green in here.</p>
                                                <p> See if I can make an adjustment for that.</p>
                                                <p> I'm liking that better.</p>
                                                <p> I'd like to bring out some of the large-scale detail in the Milky
                                                    Way.</p>
                                                <p> I think my best bet for that is probably the Equalizer tool.</p>
                                                <p> Let's see what that looks like.</p>
                                                <p> Yeah, that really helps in here.</p>
                                                <p> Let's see what the next size down looks like.</p>
                                                <p> Oh, it brings out some of these darker ones, doesn't it? And the
                                                    next size down? Okay.</p>
                                                <p> I think I want to do two passes.</p>
                                                <p> I'll do one with this larger-scale stuff, but I want to do this
                                                    Lighten only.</p>
                                                <p> There we go.</p>
                                                <p> Then I want to catch some of these mid-scale ones Darken only.</p>
                                                <p> So, a new instance.</p>
                                                <p> Go to Luma.</p>
                                                <p> And bring this up.</p>
                                                <p> Yeah.</p>
                                                <p> A little bit of that.</p>
                                                <p> Okay.</p>
                                                <p> Uniformly.</p>
                                                <p> Darken only.</p>
                                                <p> Let's look at that.</p>
                                                <p> That was before.</p>
                                                <p> That's after.</p>
                                                <p> I like that.</p>
                                                <p> I don't like it down here, though.</p>
                                                <p> Look: I've got halos and it looks cartoonish.</p>
                                                <p> So, on both of these, I'll use a Drawn Mask and keep it away from
                                                    these high-contrast areas.</p>
                                                <p> There we go.</p>
                                                <p> Drawn Mask.</p>
                                                <p> And I'll use that same one.</p>
                                                <p> Okay, what else? The whole image is a little dark.</p>
                                                <p> I think I can brighten it up some.</p>
                                                <p> Look at this edge here: it sure looks like I can brighten it up.</p>
                                                <p> I think I want to do my final adjustments, though, with Black point
                                                    and White point, when I'm all done.</p>
                                                <p> Let's look at our stars, though, and see how they look.</p>
                                                <p> They still look a little noisy up here.</p>
                                                <p> I wonder if we can do a little color smoothing to help that out.</p>
                                                <p> Take our Radius down; go to our Color Channel only; bring our Radius
                                                    up a little.</p>
                                                <p> Well, it doesn't hurt our Milky Way, does it? And it definitely puts
                                                    that noise in check, and gets rid of some of the fringing too.</p>
                                                <p> Okay, I'm happy with that.</p>
                                                <p> We can get more of the large-scale features by using Overlay Blend
                                                    Mode.</p>
                                                <p> Let's do that.</p>
                                                <p> I'll turn my Saturation way down.</p>
                                                <p> See these features? Let's emphasize them.</p>
                                                <p> Bring our size up, like that.</p>
                                                <p> That looks good.</p>
                                                <p> Okay.</p>
                                                <p> Then change my Blend Mode to Overlay.</p>
                                                <p> I'll try increasing my Brightness some.</p>
                                                <p> Then, I don't want all of it; I just want to use a little.</p>
                                                <p> That says 35% Here's before, and there's after.</p>
                                                <p> It's a bit much in these brighter areas.</p>
                                                <p> I'll combine it with a Parametric Mask and bring down the brighter
                                                    ones a little.</p>
                                                <p> There.</p>
                                                <p> Okay.</p>
                                                <p> Before, and after.</p>
                                                <p> Oh, I think we can do it more now.</p>
                                                <p> And maybe a little smaller Radius.</p>
                                                <p> Bring the Brightness down.</p>
                                                <p> Now let's see our before and after.</p>
                                                <p> Before, and after.</p>
                                                <p> That makes it more dramatic.</p>
                                                <p> I'd like to get some more color in the Milky Way.</p>
                                                <p> I'll use the Equalizer Tool.</p>
                                                <p> So, Chroma Channel and let's try some of these larger sizes.</p>
                                                <p> Oh, look at that: that's beautiful.</p>
                                                <p> I like that.</p>
                                                <p> Then bring it back down a little.</p>
                                                <p> Okay, it's way heavy in here, so let's use a Drawn Mask.</p>
                                                <p> I like it.</p>
                                                <p> Okay, I'll save everything, then change my White point and dark
                                                    point, and then I think I'm done.</p>
                                                <p> Reflections.</p>
                                                <p> Sky.</p>
                                                <p> TIFF.</p>
                                                <p> Unique Filename.</p>
                                                <p> Here we go.</p>
                                                <p> Okay, bring up my brightness a little.</p>
                                                <p> I'm pretty happy with my dark point.</p>
                                                <p>It's right there.</p>
                                                <p> Have I got some purple fringing? No, not really; I don't.</p>
                                                <p> Well, a little bit.</p>
                                                <p> A little bit of purple fringing.</p>
                                                <p> Once again, I think we can hit it with this.</p>
                                                <p> I know we did this once before.</p>
                                                <p> C Channel.</p>
                                                <p> Take these brighter parts, this way.</p>
                                                <p> There we go.</p>
                                                <p> Those fringe parts right there.</p>
                                                <p> Mask Blur, a little.</p>
                                                <p> And I hope we're not into the Milky Way here.</p>
                                                <p> No, we're not, but we've got this down here.</p>
                                                <p> I don't mind knocking that down a little, though; that is a little
                                                    bit much, isn't it? Let's see if it's too much, though.</p>
                                                <p> Okay, turn off that and let's turn down our Saturation.</p>
                                                <p> Oh, good: that got rid of a lot of that fringing.</p>
                                                <p> And, before, and after.</p>
                                                <p> Yes! Too much, though.</p>
                                                <p> Bring up our Saturation a little.</p>
                                                <p> Okay, now: what did it do down here? Oh, that doesn't work.</p>
                                                <p> So, I'll combine that with a Drawn Mask and get rid of this.</p>
                                                <p> There we go.</p>
                                                <p> Everything else good? Maybe a final sharpening? Not much.</p>
                                                <p> Alright.</p>
                                                <p> Hey, that was a great year! I'm so looking forward to 2017! (Mouse's
                                                    voice) Aloha friends.</p>
                                                <p> Thank you for bringing in the new year with us here at Weekly
                                                    Edit.</p>
                                                <p> This was a fun edit, and I'm glad we got to share it with you.</p>
                                                <p> Speaking of sharing, we love it when you upload your Edit my RAW
                                                    submissions.</p>
                                                <p> Not only is it a challenge and part of the show, but it inspires us
                                                    to do a little research, find out some new things to share with you,
                                                    and it shows us glimpses of the world through your cameras.</p>
                                                <p> It's nice to step outside ourselves and see what you are looking
                                                    at.</p>
                                                <p> And always, feel free to contact us: durgin.harry@gmail.com We
                                                    always reply and we love to hear from you.</p>
                                                <p> This week we got a fun share.</p>
                                                <p> We showed up on a French Darktable website! This was thrilling for
                                                    us.</p>
                                                <p> We felt international.</p>
                                                <p> It was cool to see ourselves in another language.</p>
                                                <p> So: thank you to darktable-fr! Don't forget, you can find us on
                                                    Patreon, where you can become a patron and support us.</p>
                                                <p> You can also find out what our next week's show will be.</p>
                                                <p> And we love to hear from you on YouTube! We get some great comments,
                                                    and we really enjoy responding to them.</p>
                                                <p> Again, we always respond -- and we love to hear from you.</p>
                                                <p> So, please: send us your comments.</p>
                                                <p> We'll see you next week on Weekly Edit! Aloha.</p>
