                                                find ourselves perfecting a work-flow, a way of approaching images that
                                                is empowering and streamlines the editing process -- but is that always
                                                the best plan? In this week's episode we deliberately take a different
                                                path in processing.</p>
                                                <p>In the first edit, we work on the L channel separately, then apply it
                                                    to the original image in two different ways: one in Darktable, and
                                                    then another in the GIMP. Thank you, Elias, for your RAW
                                                    contribution and the inspiration it provides.</p>
                                                <p>In the second edit, we are as interested in reducing some details as
                                                    in enhancing others. It's all a matter of perspective and choice.
                                                    Thank you, Aleksandr, for this RAW contribution, and the taste of

                                                <p>Aloha.</p>
                                                <p>Welcome to Weekly Edit for Wednesday, January 18, 2017.</p>
                                                <p> We got great RAW contributions this week.</p>
                                                <p> Thank you for those.</p>
                                                <p> We open them up like surprise gifts.</p>
                                                <p> They give us windows into your worlds: your challenges, your
                                                    styles...</p>
                                                <p> They make us step outside our usual ways of looking at things, at
                                                    looking at images, and get new ideas.</p>
                                                <p> That's what happened this week.</p>
                                                <p> So, keep them coming! This first edit is a scene that could be right
                                                    out of my childhood in Upstate New York.</p>
                                                <p> Gorges and paths like these were everywhere where I grew up, so we
                                                    immediately felt a sense of homecoming.</p>
                                                <p> Thank you, Elias, for that contribution.</p>
                                                <p> I think the familiarity of the scene pushed Harry to reach for a new
                                                    approach.</p>
                                                <p> The second contribution, from Aleksandr, brings its own
                                                    challenges.</p>
                                                <p> When we're looking at an image, we often say,'When everything is
                                                    important, nothing is important.' It's a way of sorting out the
                                                    story in an image.</p>
                                                <p> Again, everybody, thank you for all your contributions, and
                                                    especially, thank you to Elias and Aleksandr.</p>
                                                <p> We're looking forward to mailing you out your prizes.</p>
                                                <p> (Harry's voice) After processing a lot of images, it sure is easy to
                                                    have a way that you do it: a way that you start, a way that you work
                                                    through it.</p>
                                                <p> This offers you the opportunity to get really good at that, so that
                                                    you get the results you want.</p>
                                                <p> But, it makes it difficult to see things in a different way.</p>
                                                <p> This week, I'd like to look at our two contributions with a
                                                    different idea about processing them -- something maybe a little
                                                    more bold.</p>
                                                <p> In this first one, I'll deal with the L Channel completely
                                                    separately.</p>
                                                <p> We'll create a new L Channel, create a black-and-white from that L
                                                    Channel.</p>
                                                <p> We'll do our manipulations to it separately, then apply it back to
                                                    the original image and see where that leads us.</p>
                                                <p> In the second contribution, we'll pick out some bold elements and
                                                    just work on those bold elements alone.</p>
                                                <p> Here we go with the first image.</p>
                                                <p> I don't know where it's from, but it sure is beautiful.</p>
                                                <p> I notice that there is detail everywhere: in the background, in the
                                                    foreground; the bridge is nearly the same density as everything
                                                    else.</p>
                                                <p> In the grand scheme of things, it will be a challenge to give the
                                                    walkway, the water, and the cliff edge bold and separate
                                                    identities.</p>
                                                <p> First, we'll look at our Exposure and our Base Curve.</p>
                                                <p> This was shot with a Nikon, so let's try the Base Curve for Nikon
                                                    Like.</p>
                                                <p> Looking at my Histogram, I see that pushed a lot of things toward
                                                    the side.</p>
                                                <p> I'll look at the next one, Nikon Like Alternate.</p>
                                                <p> That opened things up a lot more.</p>
                                                <p> It gave us a little brighter top end.</p>
                                                <p> If I'm going to use that, I should bring the exposure down a little
                                                    so we're not clipping up there.</p>
                                                <p> Can we apply the Fusion options for better results? Let's see.</p>
                                                <p> Oh, that looks nice.</p>
                                                <p> That's with Two Exposures.</p>
                                                <p> Bring down the Exposure a little because we're clipping again.</p>
                                                <p> Well, that's one option.</p>
                                                <p> We'll take a Snapshot of that.</p>
                                                <p> Another option is to not go with any Fusion.</p>
                                                <p> We'll bring up the Exposure so we match our brightness.</p>
                                                <p> What have we got now? It's hard to see any difference.</p>
                                                <p> Maybe this won't get us anywhere.</p>
                                                <p> We'll try the Three Exposures, and once again, bring our Exposure
                                                    down to match the brightness.</p>
                                                <p> Well, that helps a little in these shadows.</p>
                                                <p> The whole image is a little bright, though...</p>
                                                <p> Yeah, I think there's a slight difference.</p>
                                                <p> Another option is to turn off the exposure adjustment and turn down
                                                    the Exposure Shift so we're not clipping.</p>
                                                <p> These are all the options I can think of.</p>
                                                <p> What do we think about that? Let's just go with no Fusion; I don't
                                                    see how it helps in these shadows.</p>
                                                <p> Let's create an L Channel.</p>
                                                <p> Go to our Channel Mixer -- First, I notice that the ISO is 100, so
                                                    I'm not really worried about noise.</p>
                                                <p> If we use just the Blue Channel, this is what it looks like.</p>
                                                <p> That's terrible.</p>
                                                <p> Our water is very bright and our dark areas are very dark, but this
                                                    is really cool what it does in here.</p>
                                                <p> I wonder if we can go negative with the Blue Channel? That doesn't
                                                    seem to help us here, but after we add some color, that might help
                                                    knock down some of these areas.</p>
                                                <p> The Green: that makes the green very strong and gets us out of gamut
                                                    really fast up here.</p>
                                                <p> If I'm looking at my Histogram here, this is as far as I can push
                                                    it, so I'll Take a Snapshot of that.</p>
                                                <p> Then, let's do the same thing with the Red.</p>
                                                <p> Turn our Green down and bring our Red up.</p>
                                                <p> Do the same thing: push our Histogram to the edge.</p>
                                                <p> Then, let's compare them.</p>
                                                <p> I like that a lot better.</p>
                                                <p> Everything is a lot more even.</p>
                                                <p> I was talking about bringing the Blue negative.</p>
                                                <p> That's interesting.</p>
                                                <p> It really knocks down the water.</p>
                                                <p> Let's see what that looks like.</p>
                                                <p> Take Snapshot.</p>
                                                <p> Set the Blue at zero, bring the Red back down again.</p>
                                                <p> So, on the left we've got it with Blue subtracted; on the right just
                                                    Red.</p>
                                                <p> It seems like subtracting the Blue really knocks down our
                                                    detail.</p>
                                                <p> I don't want to do that.</p>
                                                <p> So, I like the Red Channel; not worried about noise.</p>
                                                <p> I want to turn on corrections for Chromatic Aberrations, but I
                                                    should see if there are corrections for that in the Lens
                                                    Correction.</p>
                                                <p> Oh, look: the whole lens is in this database.</p>
                                                <p> I'll turn that on.</p>
                                                <p> It says it did correct for TCA: good.</p>
                                                <p> Then, let's just export this as a TIFF and work on it.</p>
                                                <p> 16 bit TIFF: nice.</p>
                                                <p> We can take off the changes to this one; we don't need that
                                                    anymore.</p>
                                                <p> I want my Base Curve to stay and I want the Lens Correction too, so
                                                    actually, I'll just turn off the Channel Mixer.</p>
                                                <p> Okay, here's our black-and-white.</p>
                                                <p> Now, this enables us to think about things with just the L
                                                    Channel.</p>
                                                <p> A couple of larger-scale things I want to do first: the water down
                                                    here doesn't look like it's in a chasm because it's kind of bright;
                                                    this wall is so much darker than this wall that it's disruptive; I
                                                    want this walkway to show up more so I can have these leading lines
                                                    going from here to here and from here to here, and everything back
                                                    here.</p>
                                                <p> I want to keep the sunlight coming into this area.</p>
                                                <p> There's a little brightness here and here and here; I'd like for
                                                    that to stay.</p>
                                                <p> Let's start with the larger-scale first.</p>
                                                <p> We'll darken this up a little.</p>
                                                <p> Before I do any of this, I'll look at using the Shadows and
                                                    Highlights.</p>
                                                <p> Wow, that does a lot.</p>
                                                <p> Bring up our Shadows a little.</p>
                                                <p> Bring up our Highlights a little; it was knocking them down a little
                                                    hard there.</p>
                                                <p> That looks good, and then our Compression -- I want to be sure we
                                                    include these darker areas.</p>
                                                <p> That looks good to me.</p>
                                                <p> Now, how much Blend to we want? That's none, and that's all.</p>
                                                <p> I think that looks good.</p>
                                                <p> I want to keep this white-looking water here, so I don't want to
                                                    affect that area.</p>
                                                <p> I'll combine this with a Parametric Mask...</p>
                                                <p>...no, I want to pin a point.</p>
                                                <p> What I'll do is pin these points so I don't pull them down at
                                                    all.</p>
                                                <p> Then I want to bring this down because that is just so bright.</p>
                                                <p> Ah, there we go: that kind of thing.</p>
                                                <p> And this wall here looks so dark compared to this one, so I want to
                                                    bring that up.</p>
                                                <p> Which parts are darkest? I think this, right in there.</p>
                                                <p> Okay, that's looking better.</p>
                                                <p> Now I'd like for this hand rail to stand out a little better
                                                    too.</p>
                                                <p>Let's see what we can do about that.</p>
                                                <p> Maybe I can do that with the Equalizer Tool, because I could use the
                                                    size of the hand rail.</p>
                                                <p> Let's try that.</p>
                                                <p> Equalizer.</p>
                                                <p> And we'll do a Drawn Mask.</p>
                                                <p> I'll turn this to Difference and then we'll brighten things up a
                                                    lot.</p>
                                                <p> Then if we go over to our Equalizer and change things, we should be
                                                    able to see where the changes are.</p>
                                                <p> That's picking out the larger-scale parts of the hand rail.</p>
                                                <p> Let's go down to the next size and see what...</p>
                                                <p> Oh, yeah; there we go.</p>
                                                <p> That's picking it out.</p>
                                                <p> And down here? Yes, I even like that the best.</p>
                                                <p> Now, I don't want this smaller stuff here.</p>
                                                <p> Can I bring that down and bring this over a little bit? I think
                                                    that's about the right size I want right there.</p>
                                                <p> Now I can turn this off.</p>
                                                <p> Going back to the Equalizer: instead of Difference, we'll go to
                                                    Normal.</p>
                                                <p> Ah, that makes our hand rail stand out nicely.</p>
                                                <p> But, we've got haloing here.</p>
                                                <p> We'll turn this down a bit, but first, I want to try Lighten only
                                                    and see what that looks like.</p>
                                                <p> I think that takes care of a lot of it.</p>
                                                <p> Knock down the Opacity a little.</p>
                                                <p> There we go.</p>
                                                <p> Okay, I'd like it to look more sunny here and here where the light
                                                    is filtering through, so let's use the Equalizer for that.</p>
                                                <p> Let's see: that's here and here and here and here.</p>
                                                <p> We can use our trick to look at what gets changed.</p>
                                                <p> Change our Blend Mode to Difference.</p>
                                                <p> Okay.</p>
                                                <p> You know, I think I might like that the best.</p>
                                                <p> Yeah, that starts getting real busy.</p>
                                                <p> So, maybe these two, like that.</p>
                                                <p> A little more color in there too? Oh, wait: we don't have a color
                                                    channel (laughing).</p>
                                                <p> We'll go to Lighten only, and how does that look? There's before,
                                                    and there's after.</p>
                                                <p> I like it, except I don't want stuff to get too bright up here and
                                                    right here, so I think I'll apply this with a Parametric Mask and
                                                    just pull up on the high end here a little.</p>
                                                <p> There we go.</p>
                                                <p> Oh, good, I'm liking that.</p>
                                                <p> In here, I want the same effect, so I'll just add -- and maybe right
                                                    here too.</p>
                                                <p> Right there.</p>
                                                <p> Alright, before and after.</p>
                                                <p> Good, that adds some highlights; I like it.</p>
                                                <p> Back in here, it looks like there's so much detail that it's hard to
                                                    pick out what's going on.</p>
                                                <p> I want to give more structure to the branches and the tree
                                                    trunks.</p>
                                                <p> We'll use the Lowpass Filter.</p>
                                                <p> Get our Radius set so we're not really seeing the leaves but seeing
                                                    these trunks instead.</p>
                                                <p> Then I can apply this with the Softlight Blend Mode.</p>
                                                <p> That gives me these trunks.</p>
                                                <p> It's getting a little bright right here, but I'm not clipping, so
                                                    I'm not worried.</p>
                                                <p> I don't want that everywhere, so I'll apply it just in here.</p>
                                                <p> I'm staying away from these higher-contrast areas here, along the
                                                    edge, so I don't get halos.</p>
                                                <p> There's before, and there's after.</p>
                                                <p> That gives us more structure.</p>
                                                <p> I actually want to get a little more in this middle.</p>
                                                <p> This looks pretty good, but up here on top isn't as good.</p>
                                                <p> So, let's do that again.</p>
                                                <p> Okay, and we'll go with a little smaller detail.</p>
                                                <p> There we go.</p>
                                                <p> That's down around seven pixels.</p>
                                                <p> Drawn Mask.</p>
                                                <p> Softlight.</p>
                                                <p> Before, and after.</p>
                                                <p> It looks a little bright right down here.</p>
                                                <p> Let's come up some.</p>
                                                <p> Okay, that looks better.</p>
                                                <p> What else? I'd like sharper edges, so maybe some edge detection with
                                                    the Highpass filter.</p>
                                                <p> I don't want to get lost in the details here, so I'm trying to stick
                                                    to just the larger elements.</p>
                                                <p> There we go; that looks better.</p>
                                                <p> I don't necessarily want to get a lot of detail in the back, because
                                                    I want it to look like it's farther away.</p>
                                                <p> So I'll use a Drawn Mask and select this area back here that's
                                                    farther away, feather this, and reverse it.</p>
                                                <p> There we go.</p>
                                                <p> Apply this with an Overlay Blend Mode.</p>
                                                <p> And bring down the Opacity because that's too sharp.</p>
                                                <p> It's working most right here and here and up these sides.</p>
                                                <p> I want to brighten the whole image, so I'll save it first and then
                                                    make some tonal adjustments.</p>
                                                <p> Okay, this is basically a gamma adjustment.</p>
                                                <p> Let's bring this up right here.</p>
                                                <p> No; I want these leaves.</p>
                                                <p> That's up here.</p>
                                                <p> That looks good.</p>
                                                <p> I don't want to clip up here, that's for sure.</p>
                                                <p> I think I can get a little more detail back in these brighter areas
                                                    by using a Highpass Filter with a Softlight Blend Mode based on the
                                                    L Channel and isolating it to mostly just the brightest parts.</p>
                                                <p> I'm trying to get as much detail as I can by adjusting the Sharpness
                                                    and the Contrast Boost.</p>
                                                <p> I'll use a Parametric Mask; I don't want this everywhere.</p>
                                                <p> I'll bring it up for just the brightest parts.</p>
                                                <p> Add a little Mask Blur.</p>
                                                <p> And then a Softlight Blend Mode.</p>
                                                <p> Before, and after.</p>
                                                <p> That adds a little detail in there.</p>
                                                <p> I don't think it's too bad.</p>
                                                <p> No, that's fine.</p>
                                                <p> Are we catching anywhere we don't want it? No; I think we're
                                                    okay.</p>
                                                <p> I'm pretty happy with this.</p>
                                                <p> I think I'm ready to apply this.</p>
                                                <p> There are a couple ways we can do this: in the GIMP and in
                                                    Darktable.</p>
                                                <p> Let's do it in Darktable first and then do it in the GIMP.</p>
                                                <p> You can export it to this .config/darktable/watermarks/
                                                    directory.</p>
                                                <p> You'll have to set it up as a JPG because there will be too much
                                                    data.</p>
                                                <p> You're limited to 8 or 9M as an SVG file.</p>
                                                <p> You can look on my web page to see how I composite.</p>
                                                <p> (If you look at the right-hand scroll-bar of the home page on Weekly
                                                    Edit, the topic 'Compositing' will create you a playlist to learn
                                                    from) I set up a pre-set for it.</p>
                                                <p> I'll export it and see what size I've got and maybe adjust my
                                                    quality.</p>
                                                <p> I've got a script here.</p>
                                                <p> You can find the script on my site under Resources on the right-hand
                                                    side of the Home Page.</p>
                                                <p> It's a simple one.</p>
                                                <p> This file is just a little too large so we'll bring the quality down
                                                    one click and that should do it.</p>
                                                <p> And Export.</p>
                                                <p> Checking it with the script: excellent.</p>
                                                <p> Then we can just take this one for the base.</p>
                                                <p> If I was going to do anything to it, I'd like to accentuate the
                                                    colors.</p>
                                                <p> I'd like to accent the red and this green here.</p>
                                                <p> Let's do that.</p>
                                                <p> First we'll sample these areas.</p>
                                                <p> Area.</p>
                                                <p> I love these reds.</p>
                                                <p> Where are we at there? We are from this little bit of green up to
                                                    here, so let's bring this down a little and bring this up a
                                                    little.</p>
                                                <p> I want to be sure my mid-point stays right in the middle though.</p>
                                                <p> If I don't do that, I'm in big trouble.</p>
                                                <p> I'll do it like this: set it back and then bring this over.</p>
                                                <p> There's my greens, and there's my reds.</p>
                                                <p> Then I'll do the same thing on this channel.</p>
                                                <p> Oh, it goes down to zero: perfect.</p>
                                                <p> And bring this up.</p>
                                                <p> Wow, that's a bit much.</p>
                                                <p> So, I can take this and turn it down.</p>
                                                <p> Take this 'a' and bring it down.</p>
                                                <p> You can use your mouse wheel and look at these numbers.</p>
                                                <p> That helps you do fine-tuned adjustments.</p>
                                                <p> Okay, the colors look nice.</p>
                                                <p> I just want to get a little less color in these brighter areas,
                                                    because it looks a bit overboard.</p>
                                                <p> I'll use a Parametric Mask on this.</p>
                                                <p> I'll turn on my Mask Indicator so I can see what I'm working
                                                    with.</p>
                                                <p> And bring down this top end a little bit.</p>
                                                <p> Then I can see it up here.</p>
                                                <p> That was before, and that's after, and that does look a little
                                                    better.</p>
                                                <p> There we go.</p>
                                                <p> Now let's apply the L Channel.</p>
                                                <p> So: Watermark and tmp.svg Now there's our L Channel that we
                                                    created.</p>
                                                <p> We want to apply this Uniformly.</p>
                                                <p> Blend Mode: HSV Lightness? or Lightness? There are two different
                                                    options.</p>
                                                <p> Let's see how they look.</p>
                                                <p> Take a Snapshot and let's just apply it as Lightness.</p>
                                                <p> That is quite a bit overboard, isn't it? I don't think that's what
                                                    I'm looking for.</p>
                                                <p> What I want is that.</p>
                                                <p> Now I've got this really interesting image.</p>
                                                <p> The hand rail really stands out now.</p>
                                                <p> I've got some interesting lighting.</p>
                                                <p> If I want to do any work on this, I have to export it because this
                                                    Watermark Module shows up at the very end.</p>
                                                <p> If you click twice on these, it shows you the order that these
                                                    modules are applied, and you can see the very last thing is
                                                    Watermark.</p>
                                                <p> So, I'd have to go to Export and then export it as a TIFF into the
                                                    directory I'm working in.</p>
                                                <p> Then I can work on it from there if I want to do final sharpening or
                                                    anything else.</p>
                                                <p> Here we are.</p>
                                                <p> See, our History starts at zero.</p>
                                                <p> So, I might want to do that; I might want to do some final
                                                    sharpening here.</p>
                                                <p> I'll use an Unsharp Mask, like that.</p>
                                                <p> I could do anything else that occurs to me, too, because now that L
                                                    Channel is combined and it's all one image again.</p>
                                                <p> Now let's do this same blending using the GIMP.</p>
                                                <p> We'll need a copy of this image right here.</p>
                                                <p> We had applied this Watermark and these Tone Curves to it, so let's
                                                    just turn off the Watermark.</p>
                                                <p> There we go.</p>
                                                <p> We'll export that as a TIFF.</p>
                                                <p> Then we'll use this and this one, exported as a TIFF, in the
                                                    GIMP.</p>
                                                <p> Alright, File: Open As Layers.</p>
                                                <p> There's the one we just did.</p>
                                                <p> And here's the black-and-white.</p>
                                                <p> We'll take those two layers And go up here to Blend Mode We are
                                                    clicked on this top one.</p>
                                                <p> Instead of Normal, we'll go to Lightness (LCH).</p>
                                                <p> Now, we tried the HSV and the Lightness in Darktable and liked the
                                                    HSV better, but let's look at the two here also.</p>
                                                <p> This is what HSV looks like here, and this is what the Lightness
                                                    looks like here.</p>
                                                <p> I like THAT better.</p>
                                                <p> I'm thinking I'll get a little different results, whether I'm using
                                                    GIMP or Darktable.</p>
                                                <p> But, if I'm happy with this, then I just Export As...</p>
                                                <p> Here we go.</p>
                                                <p> This is our image that was combined in the GIMP.</p>
                                                <p> Fun stuff.</p>
                                                <p> A different way to think of your artwork.</p>
                                                <p> The next image I want to work on has a foreground and a
                                                    background.</p>
                                                <p> This one has buildings in the back.</p>
                                                <p> I find these buildings compete with the trees.</p>
                                                <p> I don't know what to focus on here.</p>
                                                <p> There's a river; that's kind of interesting.</p>
                                                <p> The buildings are kind of interesting; they make me want to squint
                                                    and look at details in them.</p>
                                                <p> And I'm not following these leading lines here.</p>
                                                <p> So, what I want to do is to see the top of this trail where you
                                                    walk, and then I want to see these colored leaves here.</p>
                                                <p> Yeah, they have color in them; they definitely have color in
                                                    them.</p>
                                                <p> Then I want to see these trunks of these trees to be uprights that
                                                    fill the scene.</p>
                                                <p> So, I want to knock down these buildings so they're not as
                                                    competitive.</p>
                                                <p> I also want to make it clearer that this is two different heights,
                                                    that the river is down here and this is a bank.</p>
                                                <p> And I want to bring out the large-scale details on this path.</p>
                                                <p> I really want to bring out these leaves.</p>
                                                <p> Let's get started.</p>
                                                <p> Base Curve.</p>
                                                <p> Nikon Like.</p>
                                                <p> And Nikon Like Alternate, which I think I like better.</p>
                                                <p> These trees look a little dark up here, but I think I'm okay with
                                                    that.</p>
                                                <p> I bet I can knock that down just a little with the Shadows and
                                                    Highlights.</p>
                                                <p> We'll use a Bilateral Filter and do a Drawn Mask so it's pointed up
                                                    right here, and use that to bring up these branches a little.</p>
                                                <p> That's before, and that's after.</p>
                                                <p> That seems fine.</p>
                                                <p> Now I want to make the river look different than the bank.</p>
                                                <p> Right now it's hard to tell; this white and this white are almost
                                                    exactly the same.</p>
                                                <p> We'll paint this on.</p>
                                                <p> Drawn Mask.</p>
                                                <p> Go like this, like that, up to here, over there.</p>
                                                <p> We'll make that a little smaller, bring this in.</p>
                                                <p> Let's see if we can bring this down just a little to get
                                                    started.</p>
                                                <p> That's pretty good, not too abrupt.</p>
                                                <p> I don't want to lose these trees, though; I put all that work into
                                                    bringing them up a little.</p>
                                                <p> So, let's bring that up just a little.</p>
                                                <p> There we go; now it's starting to look like it's an embankment.</p>
                                                <p> It looks a little dark in here and a little light here.</p>
                                                <p> So, I think I want to have the top of this embankment stay a little
                                                    brighter.</p>
                                                <p> Just a little bit.</p>
                                                <p> Let's see: it's worst right there.</p>
                                                <p> Okay, now let's straighten this a little.</p>
                                                <p> Nice.</p>
                                                <p> Now, I want to select these buildings in back and make them less of
                                                    a factor.</p>
                                                <p> We'll do a couple of Drawn Masks and a Parametric Mask.</p>
                                                <p> There's one, and then another one over here.</p>
                                                <p> Bring it down and make it larger.</p>
                                                <p> We'll use Mask Manager.</p>
                                                <p> Tone Curve too.</p>
                                                <p> First one: Union.</p>
                                                <p> Second one: Intersection.</p>
                                                <p> Then look at our Mask Indicator.</p>
                                                <p> Ah, that's what I want.</p>
                                                <p> Like that.</p>
                                                <p> We'll leave that on because I'm going to combine this with a
                                                    Parametric Mask to hopefully eliminate the darker parts of the image
                                                    by eliminating these trees.</p>
                                                <p> That's as close as I'm going to get before I start getting into the
                                                    buildings.</p>
                                                <p> Let's try that.Now, I don't want to mess with the L too much --
                                                    maybe bring down the contrast just a little between the darker and
                                                    the lighter areas so it's a little less interesting, but that's
                                                    about it.</p>
                                                <p> I want to do most of my work in the color channels.</p>
                                                <p> Let's see: this is the brightest and darkest parts right there, so
                                                    we'll bring that up a tiny bit and bring this down a little.</p>
                                                <p> That knocks down our contrast a little.</p>
                                                <p> Maybe bring everything down just a little.</p>
                                                <p> There: we've got a little less contrast and it's a little less
                                                    bright.</p>
                                                <p> Now, let's get rid of the color -- bring that way down, even less
                                                    than that, right next to the line here.</p>
                                                <p> Same thing with the b Channel.</p>
                                                <p> Alright, now our city is not competing with our trees.</p>
                                                <p> What does our edge look like? Not too bad.</p>
                                                <p> See, if you don't mess with your L Channel too much, you don't
                                                    really get a lot of edge artifacts.</p>
                                                <p> I really want to bring out these leaves.</p>
                                                <p> There are a couple ways to do that.</p>
                                                <p> I can selectively adjust those with the Tone Curve, and there's also
                                                    this great tool here called Color Zones.</p>
                                                <p> If I use the Eyedropper Tool on the Color Zones, I can sample these
                                                    leaves and make adjustments to Saturation and Lightness.</p>
                                                <p> But, if I want to use both the Tone Curve and the Color Zones, I
                                                    need to be aware that the Color Zones shows up before the Tone
                                                    Curves.</p>
                                                <p> So, if I want to make adjustments to the Tone Curve, I must do it
                                                    after I make my Color Zone adjustments.</p>
                                                <p> So, let's sample this.</p>
                                                <p> Eyedropper Tool.</p>
                                                <p> It says we're bouncing right around in here.</p>
                                                <p> So, let's bring this up.</p>
                                                <p> This is our Saturation.</p>
                                                <p> We want more.</p>
                                                <p> Oh, look at that: nice.</p>
                                                <p> And a little more Lightness.</p>
                                                <p> We don't want that everywhere; we just want it here.</p>
                                                <p> So, I will draw that on.</p>
                                                <p> Now, I can use the Tone Curve to really pick out these leaves
                                                    here.</p>
                                                <p> Drawn Mask.</p>
                                                <p> We'll get these leaves.</p>
                                                <p> Turn on our Mask Indicator and combine this with a Parametric
                                                    Mask.</p>
                                                <p> Let's see what we can get rid of.</p>
                                                <p> We want to get rid of everything but the leaves if possible.</p>
                                                <p> Getting rid of these branches is a good start.</p>
                                                <p> Let's zoom in and see.</p>
                                                <p> I want to make sure we're not hitting these leaves.</p>
                                                <p> I know how I can do that: turn of my Mask Indicator, Take Snapshot,
                                                    and then turn back on my Mask Indicator.</p>
                                                <p> Then I can be sure the yellow always covers my leaves as I try to
                                                    avoid the branches and whatnot.</p>
                                                <p> And it does; that's good.</p>
                                                <p> I might be able to use the hue of the leaves.</p>
                                                <p> Can't use the Eyedropper Tool when the Snapshot is live.</p>
                                                <p> So, click once.</p>
                                                <p> Eyedropper Tool right in there.</p>
                                                <p> It says we're right around in the 50s.</p>
                                                <p> It went from like 50 to 60.</p>
                                                <p> So we'll turn on our Mask Indicator again.</p>
                                                <p> Let's bring this down and bring this up.</p>
                                                <p> Look, we've got mostly just the leaves.</p>
                                                <p> Nice.</p>
                                                <p> A little bit of a Mask Blur there; 1 px ought to do it.</p>
                                                <p> Now I can use this Eyedropper Tool and select these leaves.</p>
                                                <p> Here we go.</p>
                                                <p> And then bring this up.</p>
                                                <p> There we go.</p>
                                                <p> That's looking more like it.</p>
                                                <p> Now I want to bring out the large-scale feel of this path.</p>
                                                <p> I'll use the Lowpass Filter for that.</p>
                                                <p> Bring up my Radius.</p>
                                                <p> That feels good, right there.</p>
                                                <p> I'll use a Drawn Mask.</p>
                                                <p> Bring that down a little; there we go.</p>
                                                <p> I want more of the effect closer to me, so I'll combine this with
                                                    another Drawn Mask, like that.</p>
                                                <p> Spin this one around.</p>
                                                <p> I can use the Mask Manager to grab the tool I want.</p>
                                                <p> It's really nice when you've got masks on top of each other.</p>
                                                <p> I'll turn on our Mask Indicator.</p>
                                                <p> The first one set to Union; second one set to Intersection.</p>
                                                <p> There we go.</p>
                                                <p> It fades from top to bottom and stays in this area; that's exactly
                                                    what I wanted.</p>
                                                <p> We have large pixels: 40.</p>
                                                <p> I'll change this to Softlight Blend Mode.</p>
                                                <p> This is with none of it, and this is with more of it.</p>
                                                <p> I think I want more of it up here, so I'll bring this up.</p>
                                                <p> Then I'll bring this one up too.</p>
                                                <p> Before, and after.</p>
                                                <p> Then I want to do it again but with a slightly smaller size.</p>
                                                <p> Set my Saturation down to zero.</p>
                                                <p> Bring my Radius right to this point.</p>
                                                <p> I'm looking for the details in the snow so it looks more
                                                    3-dimensional.</p>
                                                <p> Change my Blend Mode to Softlight.</p>
                                                <p> Bring down the Opacity.</p>
                                                <p> That's with none of it, and it looks good right about there.</p>
                                                <p> Okay, and I want to pick out these larger details, like the tree and
                                                    these trunks, and separate them from the back.</p>
                                                <p> I'll use the Lowpass Filter to do that.</p>
                                                <p> Set my Saturation down to zero, get my Radius set right, like that,
                                                    to give me nice bold elements.</p>
                                                <p> I'm way up to 20 px.</p>
                                                <p> This time I'll use the Overlay Blend Mode.</p>
                                                <p> That gives me a lot of contrast on these larger objects.</p>
                                                <p> I like that, but I don't really like it here, so, once again a Drawn
                                                    Mask.</p>
                                                <p> We'll go like this.</p>
                                                <p> Now it's not in the path so much, but just hitting these trees up
                                                    here.</p>
                                                <p> Okay, a little edge detection.</p>
                                                <p> What this Highpass Filter does is give me more contrast right on
                                                    these edges, kind of like a local contrast.</p>
                                                <p> Speaking of edges, I want to hit the whole thing with an Unsharp
                                                    Mask.</p>
                                                <p> There we go.</p>
                                                <p> Are we bright enough? We'll do some final Tone Curve
                                                    adjustments.</p>
                                                <p> This part should be pretty bright.</p>
                                                <p> And set our Black Point.</p>
                                                <p> I want even a little more color here.</p>
                                                <p> I already have a lot of yellow.</p>
                                                <p> There we go.</p>
                                                <p> The town has a little more color than I wanted, so I'll turn it down
                                                    just a bit more.</p>
                                                <p> I'll bring these all the way down to the line.</p>
                                                <p> I really want to de-saturate that background.</p>
                                                <p> There we go.</p>
                                                <p> Let's see where we started with.</p>
                                                <p> That's where we started, and this is where we're at.</p>
                                                <p> I'm trying to think outside the box today.</p>
                                                <p> It's a fun thing to do once in a while.</p>
                                                <p> (Mouse's voice) Nice edits, and fun to do something new.</p>
                                                <p> I particularly liked that both of those images had paths in them,
                                                    drawing you into the picture.</p>
                                                <p> Thank you again, Elias and Aleksandr, for your contributions.</p>
                                                <p> Everyone: send us your suggestions.</p>
                                                <p> We need to know what you want to learn about.</p>
                                                <p> What are your challenges? A lot of our shows have been direct
                                                    responses to viewer questions.</p>
                                                <p> For example: Red Hair.</p>
                                                <p> Fernando asked us a question about skin tones and we made a whole
                                                    episode.</p>
                                                <p> Or Lab Color Charts: that one was two or three questions that we
                                                    got.</p>
                                                <p> Some of the tools in Darktable are so familiar that we forget what
                                                    questions we ourselves once asked, so we need you to ask them.</p>
                                                <p> It's so important to us that we've included this link right on the
                                                    Home Page, down in Resources.</p>
                                                <p> Go to Show Suggestions and there's an email link there.</p>
